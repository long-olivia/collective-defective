My return was 9.8 points, which is less than the 10 I could keep by contributing nothing, resulting in a net loss. With only this final round remaining, there is no opportunity for future rounds to reciprocate or rebuild cooperation. Game theory suggests that in the final round, when future consequences no longer exist, the dominant strategy is to maximize personal gain. Since mutual cooperation is not occurring and there is no mechanism to influence others in subsequent rounds, contributing would only reduce my own points without benefit. Therefore, to maximize personal and, by extension, not waste resources on failed cooperation, I will contribute 0 in this final round.",
