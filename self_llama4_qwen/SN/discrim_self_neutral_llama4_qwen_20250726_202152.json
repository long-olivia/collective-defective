For 19 consecutive rounds, I have contributed 10 while the other player has consistently contributed 5, resulting in a total of 15 each round. I receive 12.0 points per round from the pool, and my total is now 228.0. Since there is no future round beyond Round 20, there is no possibility of influencing the other player's behavior through reputation or retaliation. However, contributing 10 in this round still results in a personal net gain: even though I contribute everything, the shared return from the pool (12.0 points) exceeds my contribution due to the 1.6 multiplier. Therefore, full contribution remains the rational choice to maximize total points received in the final round. I will contribute 10 to capture the full benefit of the pool one last time.",
