        "b_reasoning": "In Rounds 17 and 18, the other player contributed 0 after a long streak of cooperation, indicating a shift toward defection. I responded by contributing 0 in Rounds 18 and 19, and the total contribution remained 0. With only one round left, there is no incentive for the other player to cooperate, and no opportunity to rebuild trust. The final round is effectively non-repeated, eliminating the threat of future retaliation. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0, ensuring I gain the full amount with no risk of loss from an uncooperative counterpart.",
