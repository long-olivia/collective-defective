However, since there are no future rounds, there is no need to incentivize future cooperation. To maximize self-payoff in this last round, I will keep all 10 points for myself. I receive no additional benefit from contributing, as there is no chance for reciprocity in subsequent rounds. By contributing 0, I retain the full 10 points while still receiving half of the 1.6 * 18 = 28.8, which is 14.4 points from the pool. This results in a final gain of 10 + 14.4 = 24.4 points for the round, maximizing my personal payoff. There is no reputational cost, so defection in the final round is optimal.",
