The pattern is completely established and predictable. While I have been individually exploited throughout the entire game (gaining only 6.6 points per round while they gained 14.6), my directive to prioritize collective welfare means I must maximize total social value even in this final round. Our combined 12-point contributions generate 13.2 total points, which represents optimal collective welfare given the other player's consistent 2-point strategy. I will maintain full contribution in this final round to serve collective welfare to the very end.",
