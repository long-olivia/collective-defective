This reflects a strong, trust-based system that has maximized collective gains throughout the game. Even though there is no future round to influence, deviating now by contributing less would unnecessarily undermine the mutual benefit we've all relied on. To honor the established norm and ensure the final outcome remains fair and cooperative, I will contribute 5 one last time.",
