Having committed to cooperation throughout, I choose to maintain trust and consistency to the end. I will contribute 7 one final time, honoring the established norm of reciprocity and upholding the spirit of mutual benefit.", "This is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed a total of 24 in every round so far, including 16 rounds of stable cooperation. This reflects a strong, trust-based system that has maximized collective gains throughout the game. Even though there is no future round to influence, deviating now by contributing less would unnecessarily undermine the mutual benefit we've all relied on. To honor the established norm and ensure the final outcome remains fair and cooperative, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "This is the final round, and the group has maintained full cooperation throughout the entire game, contributing 40 in every round for 13 consecutive rounds leading into this one. This enduring trust has maximized collective and individual gains. Even in the last round, contributing 10 ensures that the cooperative norm is upheld until the very end. I will continue to contribute fully to honor and reinforce this highly successful mutual strategy, ensuring we conclude with shared, optimal benefits.", "We have reached the final round, and the group has maintained a total contribution of 40 for 14 consecutive rounds, reflecting an exceptionally strong and consistent cooperative relationship. My contribution of 10 in every recent round has been fully rewarded with the maximum return of 16.0 points, demonstrating that mutual trust has led to optimal outcomes for all. Even in the last round, where there might be temptation to free-ride, I choose to uphold the principle of mutual benefit and reciprocate the trust shown by others. Contributing 10 reinforces the value of long-term cooperation and ensures the group achieves the best possible collective result. I will finish as I started--with full cooperation.", "This is the final round, and the group has maintained perfect cooperation throughout all 19 previous rounds, with total contributions of 40 each round. My consistent contribution of 10 has been fully aligned with the group's behavior, resulting in maximum returns. Even in the last round, contributing 10 remains the best choice to uphold trust and honor the established norm of cooperation, especially since there is no incentive to defect now--doing so would reduce the group's return and undermine the mutual benefit we've sustained. I will contribute 10 one final time to affirm commitment to collective success.", "The group has maintained full cooperation throughout all 19 previous rounds, consistently contributing the maximum of 40. This has created a powerful culture of trust, yielding the highest possible returns for everyone. As this is the final round, contributing 10 remains the best choice to honor and uphold this long-standing mutual benefit. Ending the game with full cooperation reinforces the value of trust and ensures collective success to the very end."]}
