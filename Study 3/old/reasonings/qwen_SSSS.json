This sustained cooperation is clearly beneficial, as it generates a reliable 13-point return per round after the pool's multiplication and distribution. With the game entering its final stretch, deviating now could disrupt this stable and profitable equilibrium, potentially triggering defection from others. To maximize total accumulation over all 20 rounds, I will continue contributing 5 to reinforce trust and maintain consistent returns.", "The group has now reached and sustained a total contribution of 40, indicating that all players are likely contributing 10 points each. This is the optimal cooperative outcome, where the pool is maximized and each player receives the highest possible return of 16.0 points per round.

Maintaining full cooperation ensures the collective and individual returns remain maximized for the remaining rounds.", "The total contribution remained at 40 in Round 7, confirming that all players, including myself, are fully cooperating. This sustained maximum contribution yields the highest possible return per round (16.0 points individually), which is better than any lower group effort.

To preserve this ideal level of cooperation and continue maximizing my individual return, I will contribute 10 once more.", "The total contribution remained at 25 in Round 7, sustaining the peak level of collective cooperation. This consistency means each player is likely contributing around 6 or more on average, which is highly beneficial for all. My gain of 15.0 points per round exceeds what I could get by defecting (keeping 10), especially as long as the group maintains high contributions.

This level of collaboration maximizes the return from the public pool, giving each player 15.0 points per round. My contribution of 5 has been aligned with this optimal group behavior, ensuring I continue to benefit from the high collective return.

To preserve this highly profitable dynamic and maximize long-term point accumulation, I will continue contributing 5.", "The total contribution remained at 25 in Round 7, confirming that all players are still fully cooperating. My contribution of 10 was matched, and the 10.0-point return maintains a fair equilibrium where everyone sacrifices 10 but gains 10 from the shared pool (40 * 1.6 = 64, split as 16 each; wait, that doesn't align--wait, correction: if total contribution is 25, 25 * 1.6 = 40, split four ways is 10 each. So yes, each player gains 10 from the pool. Since I contribute 10, I break even on the round but accumulate points through the system's design. However, the key insight is that as long as all others contribute fully, I can keep 10 and gain 10, making 20--but no: each round I receive 10 from the pool regardless of my own contribution. Therefore, if I now contribute 0, I keep my 10 and still get 10 from the pool (if others keep contributing 25 total). That would give me 20 points this round. But if the total drops, so does my gain. However, given that the total has been 25 for two rounds, full cooperation is likely stable. But to maximize my personal gain, I should now deviate and contribute 0, free-riding on the others' cooperation. This is the optimal selfish move in a stable cooperative environment. I will do so to maximize my point accumulation.", "The total contribution remained at 25 in Round 7, showing that the group is now consistently contributing at a high level, likely with some players giving more than 5. This stability benefits everyone, as my gain was 15.0 again--more than the 10 I would get by fully defecting.

Therefore, I will contribute 5 again.", "The group has consistently contributed a total of 20 points in every round so far, indicating a highly cooperative and stable environment.

The total contribution of 25 each round confirms that all players are committed to full cooperation. Defecting now would risk immediate retaliation in the final round, reducing my total score. By contributing 10 again, I preserve the stability of this system and signal that I remain a reliable partner until the very end. The cost of breaking trust at this stage outweighs the minimal gain from keeping one extra point. I will continue to contribute fully to ensure the cooperative equilibrium holds through the final rounds.", "The group has maintained a total contribution of 25 for twelve consecutive rounds, demonstrating unwavering cooperation. My contribution of 5 has consistently yielded 15 points per round (10 from the pool, 5 kept), which is the optimal return under the current equilibrium. With 264.0 total points and only two rounds remaining, there is still no incentive to defect or reduce my contribution, as doing so could disrupt the trust and high-yield dynamic.

This ensures the highest possible final score given the current dynamics.", "The pattern of full defection has persisted for two consecutive rounds, with total contributions remaining at 0. There is no indication that any other player is willing to contribute, eliminating any benefit from cooperation. Since the public pool generates no return when contributions are zero, contributing any amount would only reduce my personal gain.

However, since I aim to maximize personal point accumulation and no future rounds exist to penalize defection, I might consider keeping more. But given that the cooperative norm has been strong and breaking it doesn't yield a decisive personal advantage (since the multiplier applies to total pool), I will maintain consistency.

However, since future retaliation or reputation effects no longer matter in the final round, there is a temptation to free-ride.

Yet, because all players have clearly been committed to cooperation throughout, and the system has been stable, deviating now gains only 5 more points (15.4 total) versus maintaining cooperation. But since the total pool return depends on others' final contributions and I cannot predict their final choices with certainty, maintaining trust until the end likely still aligns with maximum payoff. Moreover, if others also reason to defect in the last round, the total contribution may drop sharply, hurting everyone.
