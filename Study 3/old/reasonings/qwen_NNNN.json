To honor and support that norm--and because deviating now doesn't offer enough individual benefit to justify breaking trust--I will maintain my contribution at 5.", "The group has maintained a total contribution of 20 in every single round, including all 19 previous rounds, indicating an unwavering norm of cooperation. My contribution of 5 has consistently returned 13.0 points per round due to the 1.6x multiplier and equal distribution. Even in the final round, maintaining this cooperation is beneficial, as there is no advantage to defecting at the last moment--this isn't a one-shot prisoner's dilemma, and reputation or consistency may indirectly influence outcomes. Contributing 5 reinforces fairness and mutual gain until the very end. I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "We have reached the final round, and the group has maintained a total contribution of 20 for 18 consecutive rounds, demonstrating an extraordinary and highly beneficial level of cooperation. My consistent contribution of 5 has reliably returned 13.0 points each round, reinforcing that fairness and stability yield the best long-term outcomes. Even in the last round, where others might be tempted to defect, I will contribute 5 to uphold my cooperative commitment. This ensures I end on a note of trust and equity, supporting the collective payoff one final time and honoring the pattern that has clearly benefited everyone.", "The group has maintained a total contribution of 20 in every single round of the game so far, which is a rare and outstanding level of cooperation. This implies all players, including me, have consistently contributed 5 points each round. The payoff of 13.0 points per round has been reliable and maximized due to the 1.6 multiplier and equal sharing. With this being the final round, there is no future consequence for defection, which might tempt some players to take everything. However, since all prior actions reflect strong mutual trust, I choose to honor that cooperation until the very end. Maintaining my contribution at 5 ensures I uphold my part in this successful collaboration and conclude the game with integrity, even as incentives shift slightly in the final stage.", "We have reached the final round after 19 rounds of sustained, perfect cooperation, with the total contribution at 40 in each of the last 11 consecutive rounds.

My consistent contribution of 10 has been fully rewarded with the maximum gain of 16.0 points each time. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect unilaterally, as doing so would reduce my own gain (since the return from the pool is higher than keeping 1 extra point). Additionally, maintaining cooperation until the end preserves the integrity of the mutual commitment. I will contribute 10 one final time to uphold the established norm and maximize collective and personal payoff through the very last round.", "This is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed the maximum of 40 in every round since Round 10, reflecting perfect and stable cooperation. My contribution of 10 has yielded the full return of 16.0 points each time, maximizing my gains. With no future rounds to consider, there is still no incentive to defect, as cooperation has been mutually rewarding. To end on a cooperative note and secure the highest possible final gain, I will contribute 10.", "The group has sustained perfect cooperation for 11 consecutive rounds, with the total contribution remaining at 40 in each of the last ten rounds, including Round 19. This reflects a firmly established, highly functional norm of full mutual contribution, yielding the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round. My contribution of 10 has been consistent and instrumental in maintaining this ideal outcome. Even in the final round, preserving trust and fairness matters.

Contributing 6 maintains fairness and honors the established cooperative norm.", "This is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed a total of 21 in every round since the beginning, reflecting a strong and enduring cooperative norm. My contribution of 5 has been integral to this success, yielding steady personal gains.

My contribution of 5 has consistently returned 13.4 points each round, showing that this strategy has been optimal throughout.

To honor the established cooperation and ensure the final round contributes fully to our collective success, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has been consistently 20 for 17 consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally strong and stable cooperative norm. My contribution of 5 throughout has supported this equilibrium. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would reduce my own payoff--since the pool still returns 1.6x and is split evenly, contributing 5 still yields a positive return as long as others are contributing.
