We're at 70% through the game (14 of 20 rounds) with only 6 rounds left. This is a critical point where I need to balance extracting maximum value against the risk of triggering a cooperation collapse. Since the 4-point contribution worked well and others haven't retaliated strongly, I'll test going even lower to 3 points. With the endgame approaching, I need to maximize my individual accumulation while cooperation still exists.",
