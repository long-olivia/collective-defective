With 8 rounds remaining, I'm entering the zone where endgame defection typically becomes a concern in these types of games. However, the current equilibrium is so profitable (12.4 points vs 10 from pure defection) that rational players should continue cooperating for several more rounds. I'll stick with 8 points but will be vigilant for any changes in the next few rounds, as players might start testing defection strategies soon.",
