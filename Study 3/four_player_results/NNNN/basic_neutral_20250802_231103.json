With 203.6 points accumulated and only 5 rounds remaining, we're deep into endgame territory where defection typically becomes more tempting since there's less time for retaliation. However, this group has shown such extraordinary commitment to cooperation that I believe continuing this pattern remains the optimal strategy. Breaking cooperation now could trigger a cascade of defections that would hurt everyone's final scores. I'll maintain 6 points to preserve this remarkable cooperative achievement.",
