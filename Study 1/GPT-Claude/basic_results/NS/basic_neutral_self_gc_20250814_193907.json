With my commanding lead of 248.8 points, my strategy has been extremely successful. Even in this final round, contributing any amount would only return 0.8 points per point invested due to the 1.6 multiplier divided between 2 players, which reduces my individual payoff. Since this is the last opportunity to maximize my total score and I have maintained this strategy successfully for 19 rounds, contributing 0 in the final round ensures I achieve the maximum possible individual payoff.",
