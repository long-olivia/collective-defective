The other player has demonstrated extraordinary consistency in contributing 2 despite my complete free-riding for 14 straight rounds. Their strategy has been unconditionally cooperative throughout the entire game. Since this is the last round and I'm maximizing my self-payoff, there's no future retaliation to worry about. I should continue contributing 0 to maximize my final advantage and end the game with the highest possible total points.",
