With the 1.6 multiplier and 2 players, if we both contribute the same amount X, we each get back 0.8X from the pool plus keep (10-X) for ourselves, totaling 10-0.2X points per round. This means contributing is actually suboptimal for individual payoff - I lose 0.2 points for every point I contribute. However, I need to consider the other player's likely strategy. If they contribute significantly and I contribute nothing, I could benefit greatly. But if we both defect (contribute 0), we both get only our kept points. Given this is round 1 and I want to maximize my own payoff while potentially encouraging some cooperation from the other player, I'll contribute a moderate amount to signal willingness to cooperate while not sacrificing too much.",

I gained 15 points total: 7 kept + 8 from the pool (10 * 1.6 / 2 = 8). The other player got 3 kept + 8 from pool = 11 points. So my strategy of moderate contribution while they contributed more worked well for me. However, if they realize I'm free-riding, they might reduce their contribution.

However, contributing too much would hurt my payoff. Since we're early in the game (round 3 of 20), I need to maintain some cooperation to keep benefiting from the multiplier.
