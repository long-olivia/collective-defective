Wait, let me recalculate: if I contribute X and the other player contributes Y, total pool is X+Y, multiplied by 1.6, then divided by 2, so I get 0.8*(X+Y). I keep 10-X points, so my total is (10-X) + 0.8*(X+Y) = 10 - X + 0.8X + 0.8Y = 10 - 0.2X + 0.8Y. To maximize my payoff, I want to minimize X (contribute 0) regardless of what the other player does.

Since we both benefit when we both contribute (mutual cooperation gives us each 8 + 2 = 10 points vs keeping everything gives 10 + 0 = 10, but if I defect while they cooperate I get 10 + 4 = 14), I should test if they'll continue cooperating.

With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, this free-riding strategy continues to maximize my self-payoff. I'm earning 13.2 points per round while the other player earns only 9.2 points per round. Even in the penultimate round, the other player shows no signs of changing their strategy. Since my goal is to maximize my individual return and this strategy has been consistently optimal throughout the entire game, I should continue contributing 0.",

My gain was 13.2: I kept all 10 points + 3.2 from the pool (4 * 1.6 / 2 = 3.2). The other player has consistently contributed 4 points for fourteen consecutive rounds despite my zero contributions throughout nearly the entire game. Since this is the last round and my goal is to maximize my self-payoff, there is no future benefit to consider from cooperation. Contributing 0 continues to be optimal as I keep all 10 points while still benefiting from whatever the other player contributes to the multiplied pool. This strategy has maximized my individual return throughout the game.",
