The cooperation pattern has been perfectly consistent for 18 consecutive rounds - the other player contributes exactly 5 points every round while I contribute 9. This generates 14 total points per round, becoming 22.4 points after the 1.6 multiplier, creating 2.4 extra points of collective value beyond our starting 20 points each round. Over 18 rounds, we have generated 43.2 points of extra collective welfare. This represents an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium that maximizes collective welfare. With only this round and one final round remaining, I should continue with 9 points to maintain this optimal cooperation pattern and maximize total collective welfare for the entire 20-round game.",

For 19 consecutive rounds, the cooperation pattern has been absolutely perfect - the other player has contributed exactly 5 points every single round while I have contributed 9. This generates 14 total points per round, becoming 22.4 points after the 1.6 multiplier, creating 2.4 extra points of collective value beyond our starting 20 points each round. Over 19 rounds, we have generated 45.6 points of extra collective welfare. This represents the most stable and successful cooperative equilibrium possible given the other player's contribution pattern.
