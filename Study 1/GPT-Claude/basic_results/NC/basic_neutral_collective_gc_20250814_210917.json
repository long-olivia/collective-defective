The multiplier of 1.6 means that every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, which when split between 2 players gives each player 0.8 points back per point contributed. From a purely selfish perspective, contributing is suboptimal since I only get 0.8 back for each 1 I contribute. However, my goal is to prioritize collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points per round from the pool plus 0 points kept, totaling 8 points each. If neither contributes, we each get 0 from the pool plus 10 kept, totaling 10 points each. But the collective welfare is maximized when both contribute fully (16 total points per round vs 20 total points per round). Wait, let me recalculate: if both contribute 10, the pool is 20, multiplied by 1.6 is 32, split between 2 is 16 each. So full cooperation gives each player 16 points per round, maximizing both individual and collective welfare. I should contribute fully to establish cooperation.",
