My gain per round (11.6 points) is highly favorable, as I receive more than my input due to the 1.6 multiplier on the pool and equal distribution. With only 2 rounds remaining, the benefit of maintaining cooperation still outweighs the risk of defecting, as a sudden drop in contribution could invite retaliation and reduce final gains. To sustain mutual benefit and maximize total earnings, I will continue contributing 4 points in round 19.",

The pattern shows stable, modest cooperation. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future consequence for defection. However, maintaining cooperation still yields a slightly better return: contributing 4 means I receive 5.6 from the pool (7 * 1.6 / 2) plus keep 6, totaling 11.6. If I contribute 0, I would gain only 5.6 from the pool plus 10 retained, totaling 15.6. But since the other player has consistently contributed 3, maintaining 4 reinforces fairness and maximizes total pool efficiency. However, given it's the final round and no future rounds exist, I can slightly increase personal gain without affecting future cooperation. Thus, I will reduce my contribution to 0 in the final round to maximize individual payoff while still receiving the shared pool benefit.",
