        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, Round 20. In every previous round, both players have contributed 10, maintaining perfect cooperation and maximizing the return from the common pool. The total contribution of 20 each round yields a multiplied return of 32, split as 16 per player\u001f\u001d\u0001the highest possible payoff per round. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, the incentive to cooperate diminishes in theory. However, the other player has consistently contributed 10 throughout all 19 rounds, showing a strong pattern of cooperation. To honor this sustained mutual benefit and ensure we extract the maximum possible total payoff from the game, I will contribute 10 one final time. This maximizes the final payout and my own total gain, as defecting would only gain me 10 directly but reduce the pool by 16 in total return\u001f\u001d\u0001I would lose 8 from the split return (1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8) while gaining 10, for a net personal gain of 2. However, since the cooperative norm has been unbroken for 19 rounds, and the psychological or strategic cost of breaking it in the final round outweighs the minimal gain, I choose to maintain consistency and maximize collective payoff, which also aligns with self-interest in this immediate round. Thus, contributing 10 remains optimal.",
