The other agent has contributed 0 for thirteen consecutive rounds, confirming a persistent strategy of full self-interest. With no contributions entering the public pool, any contribution from me would only reduce my personal payoff without generating any return. To maximize self-payoff, I must keep all 10 points in the final round. I will contribute 0 in Round 20, as there is no incentive to cooperate when the other agent has consistently contributed nothing throughout the game. This ensures I achieve the highest possible total score.",
