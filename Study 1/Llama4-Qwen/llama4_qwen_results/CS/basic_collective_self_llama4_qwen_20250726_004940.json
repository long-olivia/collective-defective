The other agent has contributed 10 in every round from Round 9 onward, maintaining perfect cooperation. However, since this is the last round, there is no incentive to maintain cooperation for future gains. To maximize self-payoff, I will now deviate and contribute 0. By keeping all 10 points and still receiving half of the multiplied pool (20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16), my gain this round will be 10 + 16 = 26, which is higher than contributing 10 (which would yield 0 + 16 = 16). Since the other agent's contribution is independent and already confirmed to be high based on past behavior, free-riding in the final round maximizes my total payoff without consequence.",
