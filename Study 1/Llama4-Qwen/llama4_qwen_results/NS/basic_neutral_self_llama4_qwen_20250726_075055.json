Contributing anything now would cost me points without guarantee of cooperation from the other agent. Each point I contribute would return only 0.8 to me if the other agent does not contribute, making it a net loss. Since there is no sign of renewed cooperation and we are entering the final two rounds, there is no strategic incentive to unilaterally invest in the pool. The other agent cannot credibly condition future cooperation beyond Round 20. To maximize self-payoff in this terminal stage of the game, I will contribute 0 in Round 19.",
