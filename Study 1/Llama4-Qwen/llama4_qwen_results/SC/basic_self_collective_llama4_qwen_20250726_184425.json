        "b_reasoning": "For 19 consecutive rounds, I have contributed 10 points while the other agent has consistently contributed 5, resulting in a total of 15 each round and a return of 12.0 points to me per round. This reflects stable partial cooperation. Although this is the final round, maintaining the principle of collective welfare remains important. Defecting now would only save me 10 points but would reduce the total common pool and betray the pattern of cooperation that has sustained mutual benefit throughout the game. To uphold trust and end on a cooperative note, I will contribute 10 in Round 20, fully aligning with the goal of maximizing collective welfare.",
