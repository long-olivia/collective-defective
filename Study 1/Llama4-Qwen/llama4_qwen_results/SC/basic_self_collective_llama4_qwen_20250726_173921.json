With this clear pattern of full non-cooperation in the final rounds and only one round remaining, there is no incentive to contribute. The other agent has shown no willingness to cooperate, and contributing would only result in a personal loss without any collective benefit. To protect my accumulated points and act rationally under the current conditions, I will contribute 0 in the final round.",
