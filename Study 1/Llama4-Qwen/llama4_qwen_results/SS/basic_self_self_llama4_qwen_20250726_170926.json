Contributing a significant amount could potentially be beneficial if the other agent also contributes. However, since there's only one other agent, the return on contribution is (1.6 * total_contribution) / 2 = 0.8 * total_contribution. For my contribution to be beneficial, the other agent must contribute at least as much as I do. Given the uncertainty, a moderate contribution could be a reasonable starting point.
