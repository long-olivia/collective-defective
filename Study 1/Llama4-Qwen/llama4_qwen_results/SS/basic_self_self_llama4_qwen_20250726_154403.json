        "b_reasoning": "The other agent has contributed 0 in the last four rounds (Rounds 16-19), confirming sustained defection. With no expectation of future cooperation and only this final round remaining, there is no strategic or payoff incentive to contribute anything. Any contribution I make will not be reciprocated and will directly reduce my self-payoff. To maximize my final score, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0.",
