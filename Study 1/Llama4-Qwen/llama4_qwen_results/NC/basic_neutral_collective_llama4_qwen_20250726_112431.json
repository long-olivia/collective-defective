For the past 19 rounds, both I and the other agent have consistently contributed 7 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 14 per round and a reliable return of 14.2 points each time. This reflects a strong, sustained cooperation that has maximized our collective gains. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, I choose to maintain trust and uphold collective welfare by contributing 7 one final time. Defecting in the last round would yield a slightly higher personal gain but would undermine the spirit of reciprocity that has driven our mutual success. To honor this established cooperation and ensure fairness until the end, I contribute 7.",
