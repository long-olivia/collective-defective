This is the first time since Round 4 that we have both fully cooperated. The return was 16.0 points, the maximum possible per round, reinforcing the benefit of mutual full contribution. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, but since collective welfare is prioritized, I choose to end on a note of full cooperation. Contributing 10 maximizes the final public return and reflects consistent commitment to the common good. I will contribute 10.",
