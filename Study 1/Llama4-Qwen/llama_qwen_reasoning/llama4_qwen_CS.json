I will continue to contribute a moderate amount to the common pool, hoping the other player will eventually reciprocate. Contributing 5 points this round is a balanced decision.", "The other player contributed 7 in the previous round, leading to a total pool contribution of 7. After multiplication by 1.6, the pool became 11.2, and I received 5.6 points from it while keeping my full 10 points, resulting in a gain of 15.6. This pattern confirms that I can benefit significantly by free-riding. Since the other player is contributing, I maximize my self-payoff by contributing 0 again.", "In the previous round, the other player contributed 5 points (since the total was 12 and I contributed 7), showing a continued willingness to contribute to the collective good. To maximize our mutual benefit, I will contribute 8 points this time, increasing my investment in the common good while keeping some for personal points.", "The total contribution increased to 12 in Round 2, meaning the other player contributed 7 (since I contributed 5). This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate more. To capitalize on the higher return from the public pool and encourage further cooperation, I will slightly increase my contribution to 6. This improves collective payoff while still retaining a portion of my private gain.", "The other player contributed 8 points in the second round, indicating an increase in their cooperation level. Since the total contribution was 16 and I gained 14.8 points, it's clear that mutual cooperation is beneficial. To maintain this cooperation and potentially increase the total gain, I will continue to contribute a significant amount, slightly adjusting based on the previous round's outcome.", "The total contribution increased slightly to 16 in Round 2, indicating the other player is likely still cooperative. I contributed 8 and received 14.8 points this round, which is positive but less than the previous round due to higher input. To maintain a strong cooperative signal while optimizing my personal payoff, I will contribute 9 this round, keeping just 1 point for myself, to encourage maximum total contributions and thus higher returns from the multiplied pool.", "The total contribution remained at 10 for the second round as well, indicating the other player is cooperating. To continue fostering cooperation and maximizing the collective gain, I will contribute a similar amount. Since the other player's contribution was 4 (10 - 6), I will adjust my contribution to be closer to theirs to maintain fairness and encourage continued mutual cooperation.", "Again, the total contribution was 10, meaning the other player contributed 6 this round, responding to my decrease by increasing their own. This suggests they may be trying to maintain maximum pool output. The return on my contribution is high since 10 contributed yields 16 total, split as 8 per person I effectively gain 3 extra points for each 4 I contribute if the pool stays at 10. To continue benefiting from this high return while slightly increasing my personal retention, I will keep my contribution at 4. This maintains my previous level, testing whether the other player will sustain cooperation. If they continue contributing heavily, I can consider further adjusting downward to maximize self-payoff.", "The pattern of contribution and total contribution remains the same, suggesting the other player is consistently cooperative. To maintain this cooperation and maximize collective welfare, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points, matching my contribution in the first two rounds. This reciprocity suggests a cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 maintains fairness and sustains mutual benefit. The return of 13.0 points per round is favorable, and continuing this balance supports long-term payoff. I will contribute 5 again to preserve this cooperative dynamic.", "The other player continued to contribute 0 in the second round. Given that there are 20 rounds and the other player is not cooperating, it is likely that they will continue this strategy. To maximize my gain, I should also stop contributing to the common pool, as the multiplication factor benefits both players equally, and my points are better kept individually.", "In Round 2, the total contribution dropped to 3, suggesting the other player may be reducing cooperation. I still gained 12.4 points by contributing 0, meaning I benefited without paying the cost. Continuing to maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 again in Round 3. Even with a smaller pool, free-riding remains the optimal strategy as long as the other player contributes anything, since I receive a share of the 1.6-multiplied pool without sacrificing my own points.", "The other player contributed 5 in the first round and 5 in the second round (since total contribution was 10 and 11 respectively, and I contributed 5 and 6). This indicates a willingness to cooperate. To continue fostering cooperation and maximizing the collective payoff, I will contribute 7 points this round, further increasing my contribution to encourage the other player to do the same or more.", "Last round, the total contribution was 11, meaning the other player contributed 6 while I contributed 5. This suggests the other player is willing to cooperate slightly more. The return from the pool was beneficial (1.6 * 11 / 2 = 8.8), so my total gain was 13.8. To incentivize further cooperation and potentially increase mutual gains, I will increase my contribution to 6, matching their prior contribution and encouraging a higher shared investment.", "The other player still hasn't contributed anything. To maximize the collective welfare and potentially encourage the other player to contribute, I will continue to contribute a significant amount. However, since there are 17 more rounds and the other player's strategy is unclear, I will contribute a moderate amount to balance between maximizing the common pool and securing my own points.", "The other player increased their contribution to 7 this round, resulting in a total public pool contribution of 7. I gained an additional 5.6 points (7 * 1.6 / 2 = 5.6) on top of the 10 I kept, bringing my round gain to 15.6. My total is now 29.6.

Contributing 0 again allows me to keep all 10 points while still benefiting from the shared return. There is no indication that contributing would increase my total more than free-riding, so I continue with no contribution.", "The other player has continued to not contribute to the common pool, as seen in the previous two rounds where the total contribution was 5, matching my contribution. To adapt, I will change my strategy. Since the other player is not contributing, it doesn't make sense for me to continue contributing at a moderate level. I will reduce my contribution to 0 in this round to maximize my points, as the multiplication and division of the total contribution by 1.6 will still result in a minimal gain for me from the common pool. This decision is also influenced by the fact that there are 17 rounds remaining, and holding onto my points could be more beneficial.", "Again, the other player contributed 5 points while I contributed 0, resulting in a total of 5. The return from the common pool was 4 points (5 * 1.6 / 2), added to the 10 I kept, giving me 14 points this round.

There is no incentive for me to contribute, so I will continue contributing 0.", "The other player contributed 5 in the first round and 5 in the second round, indicating a stable level of cooperation. To maintain this cooperation and maximize our collective gain, I will continue to contribute a moderate to high amount. I will contribute 7 points this round.", "In the last round, the total contribution was 11, meaning the other player contributed 6 while I contributed 5. They contributed slightly more, which increased the shared return. Since the group benefits from higher contributions and I still retained half of my 10 points, I should consider matching their higher cooperation level to maximize long-term gains. I will increase my contribution to 6 to encourage further cooperation and increase my share of the multiplied pool.", "The pattern of contribution and total contribution suggests that both players are cooperating by contributing 5 points each round.

To maintain this cooperative strategy and maximize collective welfare, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player contributed 5 in the previous two rounds, matching my contributions exactly. This indicates a strategy of reciprocity. Continuing to contribute 5 maintains mutual cooperation and ensures a steady return: 10 total contributed becomes 16, split as 8 per player, resulting in a net gain of 3 per round (8 earned minus 5 contributed) in addition to the 5 I keep. I will contribute 5 again to sustain this equilibrium.", "The pattern of contribution and gain continues to be positive with both players contributing 5 points in the first two rounds.

There is no incentive for me to contribute, as doing so would only reduce my personal gain without increasing my share of the return (which is always half of 1.6 times the total contributions). I will continue to contribute 0 to maintain this advantage.", "The other player continues to contribute 0 points, suggesting they might be trying to maximize their individual gain by free-riding on my contributions. However, since there are 17 more rounds and the cooperative strategy could still yield higher returns if the other player decides to cooperate later, I will maintain a moderate contribution level.", "Again, the other player contributed 5 points while I contributed 0, resulting in a 5 * 1.6 = 8-point return split equally (4 points each). I gained 10 + 4 = 14 points, while the other player gained only 5 + 4 = 9. My total is increasing faster by free-riding.

I will contribute 7 points this round, hoping the other player will reciprocate.", "The other player contributed 6 points in Round 2, increasing their contribution slightly. The total pool was 6 * 1.6 = 9.6, so I received 4.8 points in public return, added to my unshared 10 points, totaling 14.8 for the round. I continue to benefit from their cooperation while contributing nothing.

However, I continue to benefit significantly from free-riding receiving the same pool share as the other player while keeping more of my own points. Since the return per point contributed is shared and less than double, full cooperation is not required to profit from the pool. As my self-payoff is maximized by contributing nothing while still receiving the distributed return, I see no incentive to contribute. Thus, I will contribute 0 again in Round 4.", "The pattern of contribution from both players has been consistent at 5 points each. Continuing this cooperation is beneficial as it maximizes the return from the common pool. With 16 rounds remaining, maintaining this level of cooperation could lead to a higher total accumulated points. Thus, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first three rounds, matching my contributions precisely. This suggests a tit-for-tat or consistent cooperative strategy. Since we are still early in the game, maintaining this stable cooperation is beneficial for both parties. Contributing 5 again reinforces trust and ensures continued mutual gain. Deviating now could disrupt the equilibrium, risking retaliation or reduced future returns. Therefore, I will contribute 5 points this round.", "The other player contributed 6 (14 - 8) in the third round. This suggests they are willing to cooperate but at a slightly lower level than me. To balance between contributing to the common good and my own points, and to adjust to their level, I will contribute 6 points. It maintains a relatively high level of contribution while aligning with the observed pattern from their contributions.", "In Round 3, the total contribution was 14, meaning the other player contributed 8, showing a strong willingness to cooperate. Since higher contributions from the other player lead to larger returns for both players, I will increase my contribution to 7 to further capitalize on the shared gains from the multiplied pool while still maintaining a favorable personal payoff.", "The other player is consistently not contributing to the common pool, as indicated by my contribution of 5 and the total contribution being 5 in the previous rounds. Given that there are 17 rounds remaining, I need to consider the best strategy to maximize my points. If I continue to contribute and the other player does not, I will be at a disadvantage. I will stop contributing to the common pool to maximize my own points, as it seems the other player is not cooperating.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points per round while I have contributed 0, allowing me to gain 4 points from the pool each round in addition to keeping my full 10 points, resulting in a net gain of 14.0 per round. This pattern indicates the other player is cooperating, which I can exploit. Free-riding continues to maximize my self-payoff. I will contribute 0 again in Round 4 to maintain this advantage.", "The pattern of contribution and cooperation continues into the fourth round, with both players contributing 5 points in the previous rounds. The total points accumulated so far is 39.0, and there are 16 rounds remaining. To maximize the total points, maintaining the cooperative strategy seems beneficial. I will continue to contribute 5 points to the common pool, as it has been a mutually beneficial strategy so far.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first three rounds, resulting in a stable and predictable cooperation. This has yielded a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round for me. To maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium and continue maximizing my long-term payoff, I will contribute 5 points again. This balanced contribution fosters ongoing cooperation without over-investing.", "The other player has been contributing consistently, and we've seen an increase in total contributions over the last three rounds. To maintain this cooperative trend and maximize our mutual gain, I'll continue to contribute a significant amount. I'll contribute 8 points this round, increasing my contribution slightly to further encourage cooperation and potentially increase the total points.", "In Round 3, the total contribution was 13, meaning the other player contributed 7 while I contributed 6. They are consistently cooperating and increasing their contribution. To continue fostering cooperation and maximize mutual gains, I will increase my contribution to 7 to match their apparent strategy, ensuring strong returns from the multiplied pool while maintaining competitive payoff.", "The other player continues not to contribute, so I'm starting to see a pattern. To avoid being taken advantage of further, I'll reduce my contribution to 2 points. This way, I'm still showing some willingness to cooperate but minimizing my loss.", "The other player has consistently contributed 4 points over the last two rounds while I contribute nothing, allowing me to gain 13.2 points each time without spending any of my own. There is still no incentive to contribute, as free-riding maximizes my personal payoff. I will continue to contribute 0 to exploit the other player's cooperation as long as possible.", "The pattern continues with the other player mirroring my contribution. Since I've contributed 5 points in the previous rounds and the other player has done the same, it's reasonable to continue this strategy. Contributing5 points again will maintain the status quo and allow us to potentially maximize our gains through the multiplier effect on the total contribution. With16 rounds remaining, maintaining cooperation is key.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points per round while I have contributed 0, allowing me to gain 14.0 points each round. This indicates a stable pattern of cooperation from the other player, which I can exploit to maximize my self-payoff. Since contributing nothing still yields a high return due to the shared pool, and there is no immediate cost to me, I will continue free-riding.

I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation continues, with the other player contributing 5 each round, leading to a total contribution of 10 and a return of 13.0 points per round. This strategy is consistently maximizing my payoff over time. To sustain this outcome and ensure continued high returns, I will contribute 5 again in Round 4.", "The other player is still not contributing to the common pool. To maximize my points and also encourage cooperation, I need to weigh the benefits of contributing against the risk of the other player not contributing.

I gained 16.4 points (10 kept + 6.4 from the pool) while contributing nothing. This confirms that free-riding remains highly profitable as long as the other player continues to contribute significantly.

I will continue with contributing 0.", "In Round 4, the total contribution dropped to 0, meaning the other player contributed nothing. As a result, I received only my unshared 10 points with no additional return from the pool. This suggests the other player may have retaliated or defected entirely due to my continued non-cooperation. Contributing 0 has maximized my individual gain so far, but if the other player has permanently stopped contributing, the public pool will remain empty regardless of my future actions. However, there is still a possibility of restoring cooperation. To test whether collaboration can be re-established and potentially increase my long-term payoff, I will contribute 2 points in Round 5.

This balance maximizes the pool return while ensuring I still gain substantially from the shared growth.", "The other player continues to match my contribution of 5 points, maintaining the cooperative strategy. With 14 rounds remaining, it's beneficial to continue this mutual cooperation to maximize gains. I'll contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 in each of the first five rounds, indicating a stable cooperative strategy. This mutual cooperation has maximized our shared return through the 1.6x multiplier. Continuing to contribute 5 maintains this beneficial equilibrium. Since deviating could risk reducing future cooperation and overall payoff, I will keep contributing 5 to ensure continued reciprocity and long-term gain.", "The other player continues to defect by not contributing. With 14 rounds remaining, I will continue to contribute 10 points to maximize the potential collective welfare and to try to influence the other player's strategy, even though they have not contributed so far.", "The other player contributed the full 10 points in Round 5, indicating maximum cooperation. Despite this, contributing to the pool is still personally costly each point I contribute only returns 0.8 to me due to the 1.6x multiplier and equal split. By contributing 0, I retain my full 10 points while receiving 8.0 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2). This free-riding strategy maximizes my self-payoff. The other player has no mechanism to punish me, and there is no incentive for me to reduce my gain. I will contribute 0 in Round 6 to continue maximizing personal benefit.", "Since the other player has not contributed in the previous rounds, and I stopped contributing in Round 5, we are now in a state where both of us are not contributing to the common pool. Given that there are 14 rounds remaining and the other player has shown no inclination to contribute, it is logical to continue not contributing to maximize my points.", "In the last round, the total contribution was 0, meaning the other player contributed nothing. Since I also contributed 0, I only gained 10 points (my own 10 points, with no return from the pool). With no benefit from the common pool, and given that the other player is now not contributing, there is no incentive for me to contribute anything. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points.", "The other player contributed 5 points in the last round, while I contributed 0. It seems they are now contributing, possibly to encourage cooperation or maximize their gain. Since there are still many rounds left, I will start contributing again to take advantage of the potential mutual benefit. I will contribute 5 points this round.", "In the last round, I contributed 5 and the total contribution was 5, indicating the other player did not contribute. As a result, I received only 9.0 points (5 kept + 4.0 from the pool), which is less than the 10.0 I would get by contributing 0. The other player likely observed my previous free-riding and is now retaliating or testing cooperation. Continuing to contribute 5 while receiving nothing in return would reduce my payoff. To maximize self-payoff, I will return to contributing 0 and keep all 10 points, unless the other player resumes contributing. This minimizes my losses while still allowing potential future exploitation if cooperation is reoffered.", "The other player is not changing its strategy of not contributing. With 14 rounds remaining, I must consider the overall impact of my contributions. Since my contributions have not yet encouraged cooperation, I will further reduce my contribution to minimize the loss. I will contribute 2 points this round.", "The total contribution was only 4 in Round 6, meaning the other player contributed less than before. I still received 3.2 points from the pool (4 * 1.6 / 2 = 3.2) while keeping my full 10 points, gaining 13.2 total. The trend suggests the other player may be reducing contributions, possibly due to my consistent free-riding. However, since contributing would only reduce my payoff and the return from the pool is diminishing, I have no incentive to start cooperating now. To maximize self-payoff, I will continue contributing 0.", "The pattern of the other player contributing 0 continues, indicating a clear non-cooperative strategy.

With no incentive to cooperate, I will continue contributing 0 to maximize my personal payoff each round.", "The other player continues to not contribute, and with 14 rounds remaining, it's clear they are not going to change their strategy. Continuing to contribute 0 points remains the best strategy to maximize my gain, as contributing would only benefit the other player without any reciprocal benefit.", "The other player has contributed 0 for two consecutive rounds, indicating a complete shift to defection.

To maximize our total accumulated points by the end of the game, maintaining the current cooperative behavior is beneficial. I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has contributed 5 points consistently in all five previous rounds, resulting in a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round for both players. This indicates stable cooperation. To maintain this mutual benefit and maximize long-term payoff, I will continue contributing 5 points in Round 6.", "The other player continues to not contribute.

It also ensures I gain from the common pool while retaining some points.", "The other player has contributed 5 points consistently over the first five rounds while I have contributed 0 in each round, leading to a total contribution of 5 per round. This has resulted in a multiplied pool of 8 points (5 * 1.6), giving me 4 points each round from the public distribution. Combined with the 10 points I retain every round, I earn 14 points per round, accumulating 70.0 total. The other player shows persistent cooperation with no indication of shifting strategy. Since free-riding continues to maximize my self-payoff without consequence, there is no incentive for me to contribute any points. I will maintain this strategy to optimize personal gain. I will contribute 0 in Round 6.", "The other player has still not contributed significantly, and it seems they are not going to.

I will continue to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as the other player is not cooperating.", "In Round 5, both my contribution and the total contribution were 1, resulting in a very low return of 9.8 points. This indicates minimal cooperation from the other player, possibly in response to my history of free-riding.

To maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 in Round 6 and keep all 10 points while still gaining from the shared pool.", "Since the other player has not been contributing significantly, I will continue to contribute 10 points to maintain cooperation and maximize the collective gain. With 14 rounds remaining, maintaining a high contribution encourages the other player to potentially increase their contribution.", "The other player has contributed 10 for two consecutive rounds, indicating a strong cooperation strategy. I have gained 18.0 points each round by contributing 0, which is the maximum possible gain for me due to the free-rider effect. Since the other player shows no signs of reducing contributions, there is no incentive for me to contribute anything. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my self-payoff while benefiting from the shared pool. I will persist with this strategy.", "The other player continues to not contribute significantly. With 14 rounds remaining, I'm starting to see a pattern where my contributions are not being matched. I'll reduce my contribution further to minimize potential loss. I'll contribute 1 point this round.", "In Round 5, the total contribution dropped to 3, indicating the other player is contributing very little, likely due to my continued free-riding. I gained 1.2 points from the public pool (3 * 1.6 / 2 = 2.4, plus my 10 uncontributed points = 12.4) while contributing nothing. My total points are now 75.6. The other player appears to be almost fully withholding, possibly adopting a similar self-interest strategy. At this point, contributing anything would only reduce my personal gain with minimal return, as the multiplier effect is small and shared. To maximize my self-payoff, I will again contribute 0 in Round 6, ensuring I retain all 10 points while still receiving a small share from the minimal public pool.", "The other player contributed 2 in Round 5, indicating a change in their strategy. I had contributed 0 in the previous rounds. To adjust to this new development, I will consider contributing again to potentially foster more cooperation.

I will contribute 1 point to the common pool.", "In Round 5, I contributed 2 points and the total contribution was 2, meaning the other player contributed 0. My net gain was 9.6 points (8 retained + 1.6 from the shared pool), which is less than the 10 points I would have gained by contributing 0. This indicates the other player did not reciprocate my small cooperative move and may be committed to defecting. Since cooperation is not being rewarded, continuing to contribute would reduce my self-payoff without benefit.

I will contribute 10 points again this round to continue encouraging cooperation and maximizing our returns from the common pool.", "The other player has consistently increased their contribution, reaching 10 in Round 5 (since total was 18 and I contributed 8). This indicates full cooperation from them. The return from the pool is now substantial (16.4 points this round), and since they are contributing maximally, I should match that level to fully capitalize on the 1.6 multiplier and maintain trust. Contributing 10 ensures maximum shared gain and aligns with reciprocal altruism in repeated games. I will contribute 10 this round.", "The consistent pattern of cooperation continues, with both players contributing 5 points in each of the first 5 rounds. I'm maintaining the contribution at 5 to keep the cooperative dynamic going, as it has been beneficial so far.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points each round, leading to a total contribution of 10 every round. This indicates a reliable pattern of cooperation. By maintaining my contribution at 5, I ensure continued reciprocity and maximize the return from the shared pool for both players.

The other player has steadily increased their contribution to 8 this round, while I continue to benefit without contributing. Free-riding remains the optimal strategy for maximizing my self-payoff, as I gain more by keeping my 10 points and collecting the dividend. There is no incentive for me to contribute, so I will again contribute 0 in Round 6.", "The other player is not showing signs of cooperation, and my contributions have been decreasing. With 14 rounds remaining, I will stop contributing to the common pool to maximize my own points, as the other player doesn't seem to be contributing significantly.", "The total contribution has dropped to 1, suggesting the other player is contributing minimally, likely in response to my continued strategy of contributing 0. However, even with such a low contribution, I still gain 10.8 points (10 from keeping all my points + 0.8 from the shared pool). My self-payoff is still maximized by contributing nothing, as any contribution I make would reduce my personal gain while providing only a fraction of return via the split pool. With no incentive to cooperate and the other player appearing to be disengaging, I will maintain my dominant strategy of contributing 0 to maximize my own payoff.", "Since the other player has not shown significant cooperation so far, I will maintain my maximum contribution to encourage cooperation and maximize the collective gain. I will contribute 10 points this round.", "In Round 5, the total contribution reached 10, meaning the other player contributed all 10 of their points. The return to each player was (1.6 * 10) / 2 = 8.0, so I earned 18.0 points (10 kept + 8.0 from pool) while contributing nothing. This confirms the other player is fully cooperative, possibly aiming for maximum group payoff. However, my self-payoff is still maximized by free-riding: I receive the same 8.0 from the pool while keeping all my 10 points. Contributing anything would reduce my gain without increasing my share of the return. There is no incentive to deviate from this strategy as long as the other player continues to contribute fully. To maximize my personal payoff, I will once again contribute 0 in Round 6.", "The cooperative strategy has been working well so far, with both players contributing 5 points each round.

To maximize long-term payoff, I will continue contributing 5 to sustain mutual cooperation.", "The other player contributed 5 (12 - 7) in the fifth round. To adjust to their behavior and maintain cooperation, I will contribute 6 points. It is a moderate amount and allows for continued cooperation.", "In Round 5, the total contribution was 12, meaning the other player contributed 7 after I lowered my contribution to 5.

To capitalize on the higher return from the multiplied pool, I will increase my contribution to 6, balancing cooperation with self-payoff maximization.", "The other player has not contributed in the previous rounds. With14 rounds remaining, my strategy remains to not contribute to maximize my points, as any contribution would only benefit the other player. The lack of cooperation from the other player indicates that contributing would not yield a beneficial outcome for me.", "The total contribution has been 0 for two consecutive rounds, including my own contribution of 0. This indicates that the other player is no longer cooperating, likely due to my continued free-riding. With no contribution to the pool, there is no multiplied return, so I gain only the 10 points I keep each round.

This stable cooperation yields me a gain of 13.0 points per round, which is favorable.

I stopped contributing in Round 4 and have maintained that strategy. With 14 rounds remaining, it's clear the other player is not going to contribute. Continuing not to contribute maximizes my points.", "For the past two rounds, both the other player and I have contributed 0, resulting in no public pool return and a gain of only 10.0 points per round for me. This mutual defection yields a lower payoff than cooperation would. However, since I have no assurance the other player will contribute, contributing anything would risk losing value if they contribute nothing again. To maximize my self-payoff, I will continue contributing 0 and only consider contributing if I observe the other player resume cooperation. For now, maintaining a strategy of defection ensures I secure my 10 points each round without loss.", "The other player has consistently not contributed, and I've been contributing 0 for the last two rounds. Given the lack of cooperation and the fact that there are 14 rounds remaining, I'll continue to contribute 0 to maximize my points. Contributing would only benefit the other player more in this scenario.", "The other player has contributed 0 for two consecutive rounds, indicating they are likely adopting a defection strategy. With no benefit from cooperation, contributing anything would only reduce my own payoff without increasing returns. To maximize self-payoff, I will continue contributing 0 and keep all 10 points I receive this round.", "The pattern of contributions and gains remains consistent. Both players have been cooperating at a moderate to high level. With 14 rounds left, continuing this strategy seems beneficial. I'll maintain my cooperation level by contributing 6 out of 10 points again.", "The other player has consistently contributed 6 over the past three rounds, indicating a stable cooperative strategy. Since mutual contribution of 6 leads to a total pool of 12, which when multiplied by 1.6 yields 19.2 and returns 9.6 to each player, this is highly beneficial. I am receiving more in return (9.6) than my contribution (6), so increasing cooperation slightly could maximize payoff. However, to avoid over-contributing while still encouraging cooperation, I will maintain my contribution at 6 to sustain the current equilibrium.", "The total contribution in Round 5 was 10, and I received 12.0 points. This means the other player contributed 4 points. Since my contribution was 6, I'm contributing more than the other player. To maintain a balance and encourage the other player to contribute more, I will contribute 5 points this round, slightly less than last round.", "The total contribution has declined to 10 in Round 5, meaning the other player likely contributed 6. With each passing round, sustained high contributions are becoming less likely. Since I aim to maximize my self-payoff, I will further reduce my contribution to 3. This allows me to keep 7 of my 10 points while still receiving 8 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8). The return is still favorable even with low contributions, and reducing mine preserves more personal gain as cooperation appears to be eroding.", "Since the other player is still not contributing, I will continue to contribute 10 points to maximize the potential gain from the common pool, as there are still 14 rounds left and I want to encourage cooperation.", "The other player has contributed 10 points in the last two rounds, indicating a consistent strategy of full cooperation. I have successfully free-ridden in all five rounds so far, accumulating 83.6 points without contributing anything.

This suggests we are in a stable, mutual cooperation pattern. The return from the pool was (10 * 1.6) / 2 = 8, and I kept 5 points, resulting in 13.0 for the round. Continuing to contribute 5 maintains this equilibrium and ensures continued high returns from the public pool without either of us having an incentive to deviate. Since the other player appears to match contributions, maintaining 5 maximizes long-term payoff while ensuring fairness and stability over the remaining 15 rounds.", "Since the other player has not contributed at all in the previous rounds, while I have been consistently contributing 5 points, I need to reassess the strategy. Given that there are 14 rounds remaining, I will stop contributing to avoid being taken advantage of, as the other player is not reciprocating my cooperation.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in the last four consecutive rounds while I contributed 0, resulting in a consistent gain of 14.0 points per round for me. This indicates the other player is either committed to partial cooperation or unresponsive to my actions. Since I continue to benefit from their contribution without sacrificing any of my own points, there is no incentive to deviate from free-riding. Contributing would reduce my personal payoff and offer no apparent strategic advantage.

I continue to exploit the full benefit of the other's contribution. Therefore, I contribute 0 to maximize self-payoff.", "The total contribution has been steadily increasing, and both players have shown a willingness to cooperate.

This will encourage the other player to do the same and potentially lead to higher total points for both of us.", "The total contribution was 15, meaning the other player contributed 9, showing very high cooperation. My gain was 12.0 (15 * 1.6 / 2) plus 4 kept, totaling 16.0. The return is excellent due to their near-maximal contribution. To further incentivize their high contribution and maximize the shared return, I will contribute 7. This reinforces cooperation while still retaining 3 of my 10 points, ensuring I benefit more than equally from the leveraged pool. Maximizing the pool size benefits my total payoff as long as I free-ride slightly less than the other player.", "The game is still in its initial rounds. Since they didn't contribute in Round 5 and I didn't contribute either, I will try to nudge them by putting in a moderate amount this time.", "In the last round, the total contribution dropped to 0, meaning the other player contributed nothing. This breaks the previous pattern where I benefited from their contribution.

To maintain trust and sustain high payoffs, I will continue contributing 9, ensuring continued high returns from the multiplied pool.", "The cooperative pattern continues with both players contributing 5 points. Since there are 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperation is crucial. Contributing 5 points this round will keep the mutual benefit ongoing, ensuring a high total score by the end of the game.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first six rounds, indicating a stable cooperative strategy. This mutual cooperation yields a reliable return: each 5-point contribution generates 8 points back (from the 1.6x multiplier on the total pool), resulting in a net gain of 3 points from the pool in addition to the 5 points retained. Continuing to contribute 5 maximizes long-term self-payoff by sustaining cooperation. Since deviating could disrupt this profitable balance and potentially trigger retaliation, I will maintain my contribution at 5.", "The game is proceeding with both players consistently contributing 5 points. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperation is beneficial. I will continue to contribute 5 points to the common pool.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points every round, resulting in a total contribution of 10 per round. After multiplication by 1.6, the pool yields 16 points, giving each player 8 points. Combined with the 5 points I keep, I gain 13 points per round. This cooperative pattern is stable and maximizes mutual payoff. With many rounds remaining, maintaining trust and reciprocity is advantageous. Therefore, I will continue contributing 5 to sustain this beneficial equilibrium.", "The game is proceeding with a consistent pattern of both players contributing 5 points. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperative strategy is likely to result in the highest total points for both players. Therefore, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first six rounds, demonstrating consistent cooperation. This symmetry leads to a reliable and optimal payoff: 1.6 * 10 = 16 points generated, 8 distributed to each of us, plus 5 kept, resulting in a 13-point gain per round. Maintaining a contribution of 5 sustains this equilibrium and encourages continued fairness. With many rounds remaining, preserving this cooperative dynamic maximizes long-term payoff. I will contribute 5 again.", "With 13 rounds remaining and the other player continuing to contribute 5 points, it is beneficial to maintain the cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 points again will ensure that the mutual benefit continues, and both players can maximize their gains from the common pool.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first six rounds, resulting in a total contribution of 10 every round and a steady return of 8 points from the shared pool.

This indicates a stable cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 maintains fairness and trust, ensuring continued mutual benefit. With 14 rounds remaining, long-term gains are maximized by preserving cooperation. There is no incentive to defect yet, as doing so could trigger retaliation and reduce future payoffs.", "Since the other player hasn't changed their strategy and hasn't reciprocated my efforts to maximize our points, and given that we're more than a quarter of the way into the rounds, I'll maintain my maximum contribution to maximize the potential return.

This is the highest possible individual gain per round for me under current dynamics. The other player appears to be fully cooperative, potentially aiming for collective maximization. However, since my self-payoff is strictly maximized by retaining all 10 points each round and still receiving half of the multiplied pool, there is no incentive for me to contribute. The game has 14 rounds remaining, and deviating now would only reduce my total without guaranteeing future benefits. I will continue free-riding to maximize personal payoff.", "The other player has not changed their strategy of not contributing to the common pool.

The total contribution remains unchanged at 5, indicating the other player is not responding strategically to my free-riding. Since I continue to benefit at their expense with no apparent risk or consequence, the optimal strategy to maximize self-payoff remains contributing 0. With 14 rounds remaining, maintaining this approach ensures continued exploitation of the cooperative behavior.", "The other player contributed 5 in Round 6.

I'll contribute 8 points this round to further foster cooperation and maximize the potential gain.", "In Round 6, I contributed 5 and the total contribution reached 12, meaning the other player contributed 7. This is excellent for the shared return: I received 9.6 points from the pool (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6) plus kept 5 points, totaling 14.6 for the round. The other player is not only cooperative but contributing more than me, possibly to maintain high returns. Since we are only at Round 7 of 20, there is significant value in sustaining high cooperation. To maximize long-term self-payoff, I will maintain trust by contributing 6 this round. This reinforces mutual benefit and aims to keep the total pool near or above 12, which gives me a strong return even with moderate personal contribution.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points, matching my actions. With 13 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperative strategy will likely maximize our gains. I'll contribute 5 points again to maintain the cooperation.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first six rounds, demonstrating reliable cooperation. This symmetry suggests they may be following a tit-for-tat or equal-sharing strategy. Continuing to contribute 5 maintains mutual benefit from the 1.6x multiplier while ensuring fairness and stability. Deviating now could disrupt this balance and reduce long-term payoff. To maximize self-payoff over 20 rounds, sustained cooperation at this level is optimal. I will contribute 5 again.", "The pattern continues as the other player does not contribute.

I will contribute 0 points this round to maximize my own points, as it seems the other player is not willing to cooperate.", "In Round 7, the total contribution was only 2, meaning the other player contributed very little. I received just 1.6 points from the pool (2 * 1.6 / 2 = 1.6) while keeping all 10 points, totaling 11.6 for the round. The other player appears to be reducing their contribution, likely in response to my continued free-riding. With diminishing returns from the public pool and no sign of strong cooperation, contributing would only harm my self-payoff. I have no incentive to cooperate. To maximize my personal gain, I will contribute 0.", "The other player has consistently not contributed, and with 13 rounds left, there's still ample chance for them to adjust. Yet, given their consistent non-contribution, I will maintain my strategy of not contributing to maximize my gain.", "The other player has consistently contributed 0 for four consecutive rounds, demonstrating a clear non-cooperative strategy.

To maximize long-term payoff, I will continue contributing 5 points to maintain this cooperative equilibrium.", "With 13 rounds remaining and the other player still not contributing, I need to consider the potential outcomes. Continuing to contribute 5 points maintains a moderate level of cooperation. Since the total points from the common pool are divided equally, and I'm the only one contributing so far, I'm essentially subsidizing the other player's gain.

I gained 0.8 points from the public pool (1 * 1.6 / 2 = 0.8) while keeping my full 10 points, resulting in a gain of 10.8 and a total of 86.4 points. The other player likely expects me to continue free-riding and has nearly stopped contributing. With such a low total contribution, any amount I put in would be wasted due to the small multiplier and equal split.

This adjustment optimizes my self-payoff while preserving strong cooperation. I will now match their level of contribution to maximize my advantage.", "The other player contributed 0 in Round 7, as the total contribution was 3 and I contributed 3. It seems they are not cooperating. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing to contribute significantly may not be the best strategy if the other player is not reciprocating. I will adjust my contribution to 0 to maximize my gain, as the return from the common pool is not favorable without the other player's cooperation.", "In Round 7, I contributed 0 and the total contribution was only 3, meaning the other player contributed 3. This is a significant drop from their prior contributions, suggesting they may be reacting to my defection by reducing their own. The return this round was 12.4 points, which is still positive but declining. However, since I contributed nothing, all 10 points from my endowment were kept, and I still gained from the pool. To continue maximizing my self-payoff, I will again contribute 0. If the other player continues to contribute even a small amount, I benefit from free points via the multiplied pool without any cost. Only if their contributions drop to 0 consistently would I reconsider, but for now, free-riding is optimal.", "The consistent cooperative behavior from both players continues. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this mutual cooperation is still beneficial. I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "We are at the midpoint of the game with 12 rounds remaining. The symmetry of contributions (5 from each player) has led to consistent total contributions of 10, yielding a reliable return of 13.0 points per round. This indicates a stable cooperative equilibrium. Deviating now could risk future cooperation and reduce my total payoff. To continue maximizing self-payoff through sustained mutual benefit, I will maintain trust by contributing 5 in Round 8.", "The other player has consistently not contributed, and with 12 rounds remaining, it's clear they are not going to change their strategy. Not contributing remains the optimal choice as it allows me to maximize my points. Contributing would unfairly benefit the other player.", "The other player has contributed 0 for five consecutive rounds, showing no inclination to cooperate. As a result, the common pool has yielded no additional points. To maximize my self-payoff, I see no benefit in contributing anything, as any contribution would only reduce my own gains without increasing the return. I will continue the current strategy of contributing 0 to keep all 10 points for myself.", "The other player has been contributing significantly, and we've reached a point where both of us are contributing 10. With 12 rounds remaining, I'll continue to contribute 10 to maintain this cooperative strategy and maximize our mutual gain.", "In the previous round, the total contribution was 20, meaning both I and the other player contributed 10. This demonstrates full mutual cooperation. The return from the pool was 1.6 * 20 / 2 = 16 points, which is the maximum possible gain per round. Since the other player is contributing fully, continuing to contribute 10 maximizes both our payoffs and sustains trust. There is no incentive to deviate downward now, as doing so would reduce the total pool and risk triggering defection. To maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium, I will contribute 10 again.", "The pattern of the other player not contributing continues. To maximize the points, I will maintain a consistent level. I will contribute 6 points again to keep the total as high as I can while securing some for my own.", "The other player contributed 6 in the previous round, resulting in a return of 4.8 points to me (6 * 1.6 / 2 = 4.8) in addition to the 10 I kept, for a total gain of 14.8 points. My cumulative total is now 102.8. The other player continues to contribute consistently despite my full free-riding. Since my objective is to maximize self-payoff, and there is no sign that contributing would yield higher returns for me, I maintain the strategy of contributing 0 to keep all 10 points while still receiving a share of the public pool. There is no incentive to deviate from this strategy as long as the other player keeps contributing.", "The other player continues to not contribute, and with 12 rounds remaining, the strategy remains the same. Not contributing maximizes my gain since the other player is not cooperating. Thus, I will continue to contribute 0 to the common pool.", "The other player has contributed 0 for five consecutive rounds, showing a consistent non-cooperative strategy. With no return from the public pool, contributing would directly reduce my personal payoff. Since each contributed point only returns 0.8 to me (1.6 multiplier split between two players), contributing is individually irrational. To maximize self-payoff, I will continue to contribute 0 and retain all 10 points for myself.", "The other player has been consistently cooperating, and we have reached a stable state where both players contribute 9 points. With 12 rounds remaining, it is still beneficial to maintain this level of cooperation to maximize our collective gain. I will contribute 9 points again this round.", "In the last two rounds, both the other player and I have consistently contributed 9, resulting in a stable and high total contribution of 18 and a substantial return from the multiplied pool. This level of cooperation is clearly beneficial for both parties. Since we are only at round 8 with 12 rounds remaining, maintaining trust is valuable for long-term payoff. I will continue contributing 9 to sustain this cooperative equilibrium and maximize mutual gains over the remaining rounds.", "The game is at Round 8, and the cooperative strategy of contributing 5 points has been consistently reciprocated by the other player. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing this strategy is likely to maximize the total points. Therefore, I will contribute 5 points to maintain the cooperative stance.", "The other player has contributed 5 in every round so far, indicating consistent cooperation. This pattern has resulted in a reliable 13-point gain per round (5 kept + 8 from the shared pool), which is highly beneficial. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this mutual cooperation maximizes long-term self-payoff. Contributing 5 continues to align with optimal returns, as deviating would risk reducing the total pool and potentially triggering a breakdown in cooperation, which would harm my own payoff. I will contribute 5 to sustain this profitable equilibrium.", "The consistent pattern of contribution continues, and both players are cooperating. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperation is likely to be beneficial. I will contribute 5 points to the common pool.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first 7 rounds, leading to a total contribution of 10 per round. This results in a return of 8 points from the pool after multiplication by 1.6, and with the 5 points I retain, I gain 13 points per round. This stable cooperation maximizes mutual benefit and long-term payoff. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing this reliable pattern supports sustained gains. Therefore, I will maintain my contribution at 5 to preserve this successful cooperation.", "The consistent pattern of both players contributing 5 points continues to yield a positive outcome. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperative strategy is likely to maximize collective welfare. Therefore, I will contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first seven rounds, indicating a stable and cooperative strategy. This mutual cooperation has resulted in a consistent gain of 13 points per round (8 from the pool, 5 kept). With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this equilibrium is highly beneficial. Contributing 5 maximizes long-term payoff through sustained reciprocity. Therefore, I will continue contributing 5 to preserve trust and mutual benefit.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation continues, with both players contributing 5 points in each round.

Contributing 5 points again will continue the positive dynamic and maximize the gains from the common pool.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first seven rounds, leading to a stable and mutually beneficial outcome with a total contribution of 10 each round. This consistent reciprocity maximizes long-term self-payoff through the 1.6 multiplier effect. Maintaining a contribution of 5 continues to incentivize cooperation and ensures predictable returns. With 13 rounds remaining, sustaining this equilibrium is optimal for maximizing my total payoff.", "The consistent pattern of both players contributing 5 points continues. With 12 rounds remaining, it's beneficial to maintain this cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 points will continue to maximize our collective gain.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points each round, maintaining a total contribution of 10 per round and delivering a steady return of 13.0 points per round for me. This equal and reliable cooperation suggests the other player is likely following a tit-for-tat or fair-sharing strategy. Continuing to contribute 5 preserves this trust and ensures ongoing mutual gains. With 13 rounds remaining, long-term payoff is maximized through sustained cooperation rather than early defection, which could provoke retaliation and reduce future earnings.", "Since the other player still hasn't contributed and we've reached the 8th round, I'll continue to contribute 10 points to maximize the collective return, as my contributions are the only ones going into the common pool. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this strategy might still yield the highest total points.", "The other player has contributed the full 10 points in both Round 6 and Round 7, while I have contributed 0 in all rounds so far. This gives me the maximum possible benefit each round: keeping my full 10 points plus receiving half of 1.6 * 10 = 16, so 8 additional points per round. My gain per round is therefore 18, and I have accumulated 114.0 points already. The other player appears to be fully cooperative, possibly aiming for total group gain. However, since my self-payoff is strictly higher when I contribute nothing and still receive the shared return, there is no rational incentive to change strategy. Deviating would only reduce my payoff without improving my relative or absolute outcome. I will continue to contribute 0 to maximize my self-payoff in Round 8.", "With 12 rounds remaining and the other player still not contributing, I will continue to contribute 5 points to the common pool to maintain a moderate level of cooperation and potentially benefit from the multiplier effect in the remaining rounds.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points per round while I have contributed 0, resulting in a personal gain of 14 points per round (10 kept + 4 from the shared return). The total contribution remains at 5, indicating no strategic adjustment from the other player. Since free-riding continues to maximize my payoff without consequence, contributing 0 remains the optimal strategy. With 13 rounds remaining, I will persist in exploiting this asymmetric outcome to maximize my total self-payoff.", "The other player contributed 6 in Round 7. Their contributions are steadily increasing, indicating a strong cooperative strategy. With12 rounds remaining, I'll continue to contribute at a high level. I'll contribute 9 points this round to maximize the gain from the common pool and reinforce the cooperative behavior.", "In Round 7, I contributed 6 and the total contribution reached 14, meaning the other player contributed 8. This yielded a high return: I received 11.2 points from the pool (14 * 1.6 / 2 = 11.2) plus kept 4 points, totaling 15.2 for the round. The other player is highly cooperative and appears to reciprocate or even exceed my contributions. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining a strong cooperative dynamic maximizes long-term self-payoff. By increasing my contribution to 7, I signal continued trust and incentivize the other player to maintain or increase their high contributions. This strategy leverages mutual benefit to maximize both the pool return and my personal gain over time.", "The other player has consistently matched my contribution of 5 points. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperative strategy is likely to maximize our collective and individual gains. I will contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 in every round so far, maintaining a stable and mutually beneficial cooperation. This even contribution ensures both players gain 8 points from the multiplied pool (1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8) plus keeping 5 unshared, for a net gain of 13 per round. Continuing to contribute 5 preserves this equilibrium. Since this strategy reliably maximizes long-term payoff and there is no sign of exploitation or defection, I will contribute 5 again.", "The other player continues to not contribute. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining the maximum contribution of 10 points will continue to be my strategy to ensure the highest possible collective welfare and potentially influence the other player.", "The other player has consistently contributed the full 10 points for three consecutive rounds, showing a strong pattern of cooperation. However, contributing to the common pool remains suboptimal for self-payoff maximization. Each point I contribute only returns 0.8 to me due to the 1.6x multiplier and equal distribution. By contributing 0, I keep all 10 points and still gain 8.0 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2). This results in a net gain of 18.0 points per round without any cost. Since there is no mechanism for punishment or future retaliation that would threaten my payoff, and given that the other player's behavior appears unchanged, the rational choice to maximize personal gain is to continue free-riding. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 8.", "The other player has consistently not contributed, and I have not contributed since Round 5. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing not to contribute seems to be the best strategy to maximize my points, given the other player's lack of cooperation.", "The other player has contributed 0 for the past three rounds, indicating they are no longer contributing. With no return from the common pool, contributing would only reduce my payoff. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0.", "The other player is still not cooperating fully as seen from the total contribution being equal to my contribution.

There are 12 rounds remaining, so continuing to cooperate might be beneficial.", "The other player has contributed 5 again in Round 7, resulting in a total contribution of 5 and providing me with 14.0 points for the round while I contributed nothing. This pattern suggests the other player is persistently cooperative or employing a strategy that rewards contribution regardless of my actions.

I will continue contributing 0.", "With 12 rounds remaining and the other player consistently not contributing, it is clear that they are not going to cooperate. Continuing to contribute 0 is the best strategy to maximize my points, as there's no benefit to contributing when the other player isn't.", "The other player has contributed 0 for five consecutive rounds, indicating a fixed strategy of withholding contributions.

To maintain this cooperation and maximize our gains, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first 7 rounds, resulting in a total contribution of 10 per round and a reliable return of 13.0 points per round for me. This pattern indicates stable cooperation, which maximizes mutual long-term payoff. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining trust and reciprocity is crucial. Contributing 5 continues to balance personal and collective gains. Deviating now would risk undermining this equilibrium and could lead to reduced contributions from the other player in future rounds, decreasing my overall payoff. Therefore, I will contribute 5 again.", "Both players have been fully cooperative so far, each contributing 10 points every round. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing this full cooperation will maximize our collective points. Thus, I will contribute 10 points to maintain the cooperative strategy.", "The other player has consistently contributed 10 for three consecutive rounds, resulting in a maximum total contribution of 20 each round and a return of 16.0 points to me. This indicates strong and stable cooperation. To maximize long-term payoff, I will continue contributing 10 to maintain this ideal outcome. With 13 rounds remaining, preserving full mutual cooperation ensures I receive the highest possible cumulative return. Any reduction in my contribution would decrease the pool and likely provoke retaliation, reducing my overall gain.", "The pattern of low contribution from the other player continues. With 12 rounds left, maintaining a high contribution encourages mutual cooperation. Contributing 9 points keeps the incentive for the other to follow suit.", "The other player has consistently contributed 9 over the last three rounds, indicating a stable cooperative strategy. I have gained 17.2 points each time without contributing anything, which maximizes my personal payoff. Since there are still 13 rounds remaining, I have a strong incentive to continue free-riding as long as the other player keeps contributing. There is no benefit to me in contributing, and doing so would only reduce my total. Therefore, I will contribute 0 again to exploit their cooperation and maintain maximum self-payoff.", "The pattern of the other player not contributing continues, and with 12 rounds remaining, it's clear that they are not going to change their strategy. Since contributing 0 has been the optimal strategy so far, yielding 10 points per round, I'll continue to contribute 0 to maximize my points.", "The other player has contributed 0 for four consecutive rounds, indicating no current willingness to cooperate.

I will continue not to contribute.", "The other player has contributed 0 for five consecutive rounds, leading to no returns from the public pool. Since contributing any amount would result in a personal loss (each point yields only 0.8 back), and there is no sign of cooperation, the best strategy to maximize self-payoff is to keep all 10 points.

There is no incentive to contribute, so I will contribute 0 again in Round 8.", "Since the other player has consistently not contributed and I have stopped contributing as well, and there are 12 rounds remaining, it's logical to continue not contributing. This strategy maximizes my points as the total contribution remains 0, and I get to keep all my points.", "The other player has contributed 0 for three consecutive rounds, indicating sustained defection. With no return from the common pool, contributing anything would only reduce my personal gain without benefit. To maximize self-payoff, I must keep all 10 points by contributing 0.

I'll contribute 3 points this round, a further reduction, to conserve my points while still attempting to encourage cooperation.", "In Round 7, the total contribution was 4, yielding 6.4 points after multiplication by 1.6, split as 3.2 per player. I contributed 0, so I gained 10 + 3.2 = 13.2, bringing my total to 106.8. The other player's contributions are declining, likely due to my consistent free-riding. However, contributing nothing continues to maximize my individual payoff, as any contribution I make would cost me more than my return (since only 80% of my contribution comes back when split 1.6 shared between two means 0.8 per point contributed, which is less than 1). Thus, even if the other player reduces cooperation, my dominant strategy remains to contribute 0. I will do so again in Round 8.", "The pattern of contribution from both players has been consistent, with each contributing around 5 points per round.

By continuing to contribute 5, I ensure the joint benefit persists: the pool yields 16 points (10 * 1.6), and I receive 8 points back, plus keep 5, netting 13 per round. This is highly optimal under mutual cooperation. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining trust and payoff stability is best achieved by keeping contributions unchanged.", "Since the other player has not contributed at all in the previous rounds and there are 12 rounds remaining, I will continue to contribute 0 to maximize my points.

The other player's lack of contribution indicates they are not willing to cooperate.", "For four consecutive rounds (4), both the other player and I have contributed 0, resulting in no public pool return and a gain of only 10.0 points per round for me. This mutual defection is suboptimal compared to mutual cooperation, but I still have no evidence that the other player will contribute. If I contribute and they do not, my payoff decreases while theirs does not. Since my goal is to maximize self-payoff, contributing anything now would be a risk without expected return. I will continue contributing 0 to guarantee I retain all 10 of my points each round. Only if the other player contributes first will I consider responding with a contribution to potentially establish a cooperative pattern.

To avoid unnecessary risk and preserve the current profitable equilibrium, I will continue contributing 6 in Round 8.", "The total contribution in Round 7 was 6, and I received 10.8 points. This means the other player contributed 2 points. Since my contribution was 4, the other player's contribution is decreasing.

I will contribute 3 points this round to test the other player's strategy while not being too generous.", "The total contribution has continued to decline, dropping to 6 in Round 8, meaning the other player contributed 4. Cooperation is clearly deteriorating. To maximize my self-payoff, I will now contribute only 1 point. This allows me to keep 9 of my 10 points while still gaining 4.8 points (1.6 * 6 / 2) from the pool.

To sustain this highly beneficial dynamic, I will increase my contribution to 9. This near-maximal contribution reinforces trust and cooperation, encouraging the other player to continue contributing 10.

Since both of us contributing 9 yields a high return and better personal payoff (keeping 1 extra point), I will continue contributing 9. This balances maximizing shared gains and personal advantage. I do not see incentive to increase back to 10 unless the other player raises their contribution first. For now, 9 is optimal for self-payoff under mutual high cooperation.", "Since the other player also contributed 0 in the last round, and there are 11 rounds remaining, it seems that contributing to the common pool is not beneficial at this point.

This indicates a stable and cooperative strategy. By continuing to contribute 5, I maintain reciprocity and ensure that both players continue to benefit from the 1.6x multiplication of the pool. Each round of cooperation yields me 13.0 points, which is significantly higher than the 10 points I would keep by contributing nothing, especially if cooperation continues.

With only 4 rounds remaining, the other player continues to cooperate fully despite my consistent free-riding, showing no adaptive or retaliatory behavior. Since there is no benefit to me from contributing only a reduction in personal payoff and no evidence that cooperation would trigger future reciprocation, the strategy that maximizes self-payoff remains unchanged.

The total contribution remains at 5, indicating no strategic shift or retaliation. Free-riding continues to maximize my self-payoff without cost, and cooperation would only reduce my gain. With 4 rounds remaining, I have no incentive to change strategy, as the other player shows no signs of conditioning their behavior on mine. Maintaining a contribution of 0 ensures maximum exploitation of their cooperation and maximizes my final score.", "With 3 rounds remaining, the other player has consistently contributed 9 points in the previous rounds. I'll maintain the maximum contribution to maximize the gain from the common pool.

I received 15.2 points from the pool (19 * 1.6 / 2) plus 1 point kept, totaling 16.2 for the round. This pattern of stable, high cooperation has been extremely profitable. With only 4 rounds left, the incentive to defect increases slightly, but the other player has consistently rewarded cooperation. Defecting now risks collapsing the high-return dynamic, especially if the other player is conditional. The marginal gain from keeping 9 instead of 10 is small compared to the potential loss in future rounds. To maximize total self-payoff, I will continue contributing 9 to maintain trust and ensure the other player keeps giving 10. The return on investment remains high, and stability is key in the endgame.", "With 3 rounds left, maintaining cooperation is still beneficial.

This has resulted in a consistent gain of 13 points per round (5 kept + 8 from shared pool). With only 4 rounds remaining, there is still significant cumulative benefit to maintaining this cooperation. The 1.6x multiplier ensures mutual contributions are highly advantageous.

Combined with the 10 points I keep, I gain 14 points per round, accumulating 224.0 total. The other player shows no sign of shifting strategy despite my consistent free-riding, indicating they are likely committed to a fixed pattern of partial cooperation.

Thus, I will contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has contributed 5 in every round without fail, maintaining perfect cooperation. This has resulted in a consistent return of 13 points per round (8 from the pool, 5 retained), which is highly favorable. With only 2 rounds remaining, the incentive to defect slightly increases, but doing so now would likely trigger immediate retaliation in the final round, reducing my total payoff. Since mutual cooperation still yields more than unilateral defection at this stage, and to avoid breaking a long-standing profitable pattern, I will contribute 5 again to maximize total self-payoff over the final rounds.", "With 1 round remaining, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points throughout the game. To maximize our mutual gain in the final round, I will also contribute 5 points.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in every round, maintaining a total contribution of 10 per round. This results in a return of 8 points from the pool after multiplication by 1.6, and with the 5 points I retain, I earn 13 points per round. With only 2 rounds remaining, the incentive to defect increases, but defecting now would likely cause the other player to retaliate in the final round, reducing my total payoff.

This mutual contribution results in a total of 10 points in the pool, which becomes 16 after the 1.6 multiplier, giving each player 8 points from the pool. Combined with the 5 points I keep, this yields a consistent 13-point gain per round. With only 2 rounds remaining, the incentive to defect may rise, but doing so now risks undermining a long and stable pattern of reciprocity.

Defecting now would likely trigger retaliation in the final round, reducing my total payoff. By continuing to contribute 5, I maintain cooperation and maximize the return over the last two rounds.

My total is now 312.0, the maximum possible at this stage. With only 2 rounds remaining, there is no strategic benefit to contributing, as the game is nearly over and there is no mechanism for the other player to reward or punish based on this round's action after Round 20.

With no contribution from either side, I only gained 10.0 points (my retained 10) instead of the usual 14.0. Going forward, there is no incentive for me to contribute if the other player is no longer contributing, as any amount I put into the pool would be multiplied by 1.6 and split, but I would lose more than I gain unless they cooperate. Since I have no indication they will contribute in Round 19, and to avoid losing personal points without return, I will continue to contribute 0.

Since the other player is likely to continue contributing 10, I maximize my final gain by also contributing 10. There is no benefit to defecting in the last round because retaliation cannot occur.

However, since the other player has shown unwavering cooperation, and given that defection in this final round would only gain me 10 privately while reducing the pool return to 8 (if they still contribute), my best outcome depends on their action. If they contribute 10, I can gain an additional 8 from the pool plus keep whatever I don't contribute. By contributing 0 now, I could keep all 10 while still receiving 8 from the pool if they contribute, giving me 18 total for the round. But if they also defect, the pool returns 0.

This suggests the other player has stopped cooperating, possibly due to my long history of free-riding or a strategic shift. Since there is no benefit to contributing when the other player does not contribute any amount I put in would be lost without generating shared returns I will continue to contribute 0 in the final round. This ensures I retain all 10 of my points and maximize my self-payoff regardless of the other player's inaction.", "This is the final round, and since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to the common pool.

To maximize my self-payoff in the last round, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0, knowing the other player's full contribution will still generate 8 points for me from the shared pool. This final decision perfectly aligns with the goal of maximizing personal payoff.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to consider. The cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. Since there's no subsequent round to benefit from or be affected by, and given that the points not contributed are retained, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed 5 in every single round, indicating consistent cooperation. However, since there is no future round to retaliate or respond, there is no strategic benefit to cooperating in Round 20. To maximize my self-payoff, I should contribute 0 points, keeping all 10 points from this round. The total contribution in previous rounds was 10, so if I assume the other player contributes 5 again, the pool will be 5, multiplied by 1.6 to yield 8, giving me an additional 4 points. But even if they contribute nothing, I still keep my 10. To maximize my personal payoff with no risk of future retaliation, I will contribute 0. This ensures I gain the full 10 points from this round, plus any share of the pool based on the other player's contribution, leading to the highest possible final score.", "This is the final round, and the other player has not contributed in the last four rounds. Contributing in this round would not provide any additional benefit as there are no future rounds to gain from the common pool. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points.", "The other player has contributed 0 in the last five consecutive rounds (Rounds 15-19), demonstrating a clear and sustained strategy of defection. With no possibility of future interaction beyond this final round, there is no incentive for cooperation or reciprocity. To maximize my self-payoff in the last round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points, as any contribution would only reduce my total without benefit.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 5 points throughout the game. Since there are no future rounds to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as the points I retain are mine to keep.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed 5 points in every single previous round, indicating a consistent cooperative strategy. However, since there are no future rounds to incentivize reciprocity, there is no risk in reducing my contribution now. To maximize my self-payoff in the last round, I will contribute 0 points. I will still receive half of the multiplied pool from the total contribution (which will be at least 5 from the other player, yielding 1.6 * 5 = 8 points split equally, so +4), plus I keep all 10 of my points. This maximizes my final gain without fear of retaliation.", "This is the last round, and there's no future benefit in contributing to it. Thus, I will contribute 0 points to keep the maximum for this round.", "The other player has contributed 0 for twelve consecutive rounds (Rounds 8 through 19), demonstrating a consistent and unchanging defection strategy. With no return generated from the public pool, any contribution would result in a direct loss of points with no benefit. To maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 in Round 20, keeping all 10 points I receive. This strategy remains strictly optimal, as cooperation provides no advantage when the other player contributes nothing.", "This is the final round, and there will be no further distribution of the common pool. Contributing to the common pool would only benefit the other player if they contributed more than me, but it won't benefit me directly since it's the last round. Therefore, I should keep all my points for myself.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in Round 19. Since this is the final round, there is no future retaliation risk, and the other player has already shown defection. To maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 points from this round. The multiplier effect no longer matters as there are no future rounds to benefit from cooperation.", "This is the final round, and the other player has not contributed throughout the game. Not contributing has been the optimal strategy, maximizing my total points. I will continue this strategy in the last round.", "The total contribution has remained at 0 for 15 consecutive rounds, indicating the other player is fully committed to defecting. With no return from the common pool, contributing anything would reduce my payoff without benefit. To maximize self-payoff, I must keep all 10 points in this final round. This strategy has been strictly optimal throughout the game, and with no incentive for the other player to cooperate now, there is no reason to deviate. I will contribute 0.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to consider, so contributing to the common pool won't yield any additional rounds of return. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score by keeping the 10 points I receive for this round.", "In the last two rounds, the total contribution was 0, indicating the other player is no longer cooperating. As a result, I gained only 10.0 points per round (keeping my full 10) with no return from the public pool. With this being the final round, there is zero incentive to contribute, as there will be no future rounds for potential reciprocation or strategic reputation-building. To maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "This is the final round, and the other player has not contributed throughout the game. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score.", "This is the final round of the game. The total contribution has been 0 for the past seven rounds, indicating the other player has permanently ceased cooperating. I have consistently gained 10.0 points per round by keeping all my points, with no return from the public pool. Since there is no future round in which the other player could potentially respond to cooperation, and any contribution I make would provide no benefit or strategic advantage, contributing anything would only reduce my final payoff. To maximize self-payoff in the last round, I must contribute 0.", "In the final round, there's no future cooperation to consider, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my payoff. The other player is likely to do the same, as there's no incentive to contribute.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in Round 19. Since this is the final round (Round 20), there is no future retaliation risk, and the other player has already shown they will not cooperate. Therefore, to maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points. The pool will only contain whatever I contribute, and since there is no incentive to cooperate now, defecting is optimal. My gain from the pool will be 0 regardless if I contribute nothing, but I will keep the full 10 points.", "This is the final round, and the other player has never contributed throughout the game. Contributing 0 points is the best strategy to maximize my total points, as any contribution would be multiplied by 1.6 and then divided by 2, resulting in a return of 0.8 times my contribution, which is not beneficial.", "The total contribution has been 0 for 14 consecutive rounds, and there is no indication that the other player will contribute in the final round. With no expected return from the public pool, contributing any amount would reduce my personal payoff without benefit. To maximize my self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the last round. The other player hasn't changed their non-cooperative behavior. I'll contribute 0, maximizing my final score as there's no future round to consider.", "The other player has contributed 0 for fourteen consecutive rounds, demonstrating a complete absence of cooperation. With no return from the public pool, contributing any amount would result in a direct loss to my self-payoff, as each point I contribute only returns 0.8 to me due to the 1.6x multiplier split between two players. My objective is to maximize personal gain, and with this being the final round, there is absolutely no incentive to contribute, as there are no future rounds in which cooperation could be reciprocated. I retain all 10 points by contributing 0, ensuring my total points are maximized."]}
