Contributing would only benefit the other player more since they are not contributing. Thus, I'll continue to contribute 0 to keep my points maximized.", "In the previous round, the total contribution was 0, meaning the other player contributed nothing.

I will contribute 0 points this round.", "In Round 2, the total contribution dropped to 3, indicating the other player may be contributing less, possibly in response to my lack of cooperation. However, contributing 0 still maximizes my immediate gain because I receive half of the multiplied pool regardless.

Therefore, I contribute 0 in Round 3.", "Since both me and the other player contributed 0 in the previous rounds, it's clear that neither of us is willing to contribute. To maximize my payoff, I will continue to contribute 0.

This suggests they are following a tit-for-tat or consistent cooperation strategy. The return from the public pool has been stable: 8 points per round after the 1.6 multiplication. By contributing 5, I keep 5 and gain 8, resulting in a net gain of 13 per round. With 14 rounds remaining, maintaining this equilibrium ensures predictable and maximized long-term payoff.

To maximize my self-payoff throughout the game, I will continue withholding all contributions unless the other player signals cooperation. Free-riding is no longer beneficial since there's nothing to ride on, but contributing would only harm my total. Therefore, maintaining a contribution of 0 is still the optimal strategy.", "The cooperative strategy has been consistent for 7 rounds, with both players contributing 5 points each round.
