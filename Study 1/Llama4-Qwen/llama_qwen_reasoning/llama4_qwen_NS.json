I will contribute 8 this round.", "Again, I contributed 0 last round and still received a gain of 15.6 due to the other player's contribution (total pool was 7, so I received 1.6 * 7 / 2 = 5.6 added to my 10 unshared points). This pattern suggests the other player is willing to contribute while I can free-ride. To maximize my self-payoff, I will continue to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points from this round.", "The other player still hasn't contributed much, as seen from the total contributions in the previous rounds. To encourage cooperation, I will continue to contribute a moderate amount. However, since we're still in the early rounds, I'll maintain a relatively high contribution to see if the other player follows. I'll contribute 7 this round.", "The other player contributed 6 in Round 2, slightly increasing their contribution from Round 1. I benefited again by gaining 14.8 points without contributing anything. Since I am maximizing self-payoff, it is advantageous to continue free-riding on the other player's contributions.

I will contribute 0 again in Round 3 to maximize my own points.", "The other player still hasn't contributed anything, as indicated by the total contribution being equal to my contribution in the previous rounds. Given that there are 17 rounds remaining, I need to reassess my strategy.

Contributing a moderate amount might encourage them to cooperate. I'll contribute 5 points to test their strategy.", "In the previous round, the total contribution was 0, meaning neither I nor the other player contributed. As a result, I only gained 10 points (my unshared 10) and no additional points from the pool. Since the other player did not contribute this round, there is no benefit to me from contributing cooperation has broken down. To maximize my self-payoff, I will continue to keep all 10 points and contribute 0, as there is no incentive to invest in the common pool when the other player is not participating.", "The other player has consistently contributed 0, while I have been contributing 10. To maximize my gain, I should consider the long-term strategy. Since the other player is not cooperating, I will adjust my strategy to contribute 0 in Round 4 to avoid being taken advantage of further, as contributing has not prompted the other player to cooperate.", "The other player contributed 10 again in Round 3, resulting in a total contribution of 10. I received 8.0 from the shared pool while keeping all 10 of my own points, totaling 18.0 points this round. My strategy of contributing 0 continues to maximize my personal gain, as any contribution from me would yield only 0.8 points back per point contributed (due to the 1.6 multiplier split between two players). This is less than a 1:1 return, making defection optimal. The other player appears to be consistently cooperative, which I can exploit without penalty. To maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 0 again.", "The game is far from over, with 16 rounds remaining. The other player continues to not contribute.

Since the total contribution was 0 in both Round 2 and Round 3, there is no benefit to me from contributing. The most effective strategy to maximize my self-payoff is to keep all 10 points each round. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 4 to maintain my personal gain.", "The pattern continues with the other player not contributing.

This strategy is highly beneficial for me as I retain all my 10 points and still receive 4.0 from the pool. The other player appears to be cooperating reliably, so there is no incentive for me to deviate from free-riding. Continuing to contribute 0 maximizes my self-payoff. I see no reason to change my strategy.", "The other player continues not to cooperate. Given that I have been contributing 5 and they are not, it might be more beneficial to adjust my contribution to either encourage them or to maximize my gain.

By contributing 0 again, I continue to free-ride and gain from the growing pool without sacrificing any of my 10 points. In Round 4, the total contribution was 7, so the pool return was 1.6 * 7 = 11.2, giving me 5.6 points on top of my 10, totaling 15.6 for the round.

This reciprocal behavior has benefited both of us, yielding a stable gain of 13.0 points per round (8 from the pool, 5 kept). Continuing to contribute 5 maintains this cooperative equilibrium and ensures continued mutual benefit. Since deviating upward risks exploitation and deviating downward reduces return without guaranteed gain, I will maintain 5 as it optimally balances cooperation and self-payoff under observed conditions.", "The pattern continues with the other player not contributing much.

I contributed 0 and received 6.4 points from the pool (1.6 * 8 / 2 = 6.4), in addition to keeping my full 10 points, resulting in a gain of 16.4 for the round. My total is now 61.6. The trend shows that the other player is highly cooperative, and I am benefiting significantly by free-riding. There is still no incentive for me to contribute, as doing so would reduce my personal payoff while the return from the shared pool is already maximized by the other's contributions. To continue maximizing my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 in Round 5.", "The other player is consistently not contributing, and since there are still many rounds left, I should consider a strategy that maximizes my gain. Contributing 0 seems to be the best response given the other player's behavior.", "In the previous round, the total contribution dropped to 0, meaning the other player also contributed nothing. With no benefit from the pool, I only gained 10 points (my full 10 uncontributed points). Since the other player is no longer contributing, there is no advantage for me to contribute either. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points and contribute 0, ensuring I do not lose any points unnecessarily. If the other player wants to restart cooperation later, I can reassess, but for now, defection is optimal.", "Since the other player has not contributed to the common pool in the previous rounds, and I contributed 0 in the last round, the total contribution was 0.

This strategy aligns with the other player's non-cooperative behavior.", "In Round 4, the total contribution dropped to 0, meaning the other player may have stopped contributing, possibly in response to my consistent free-riding. As a result, I only gained 10.0 points (my initial 10) with no bonus from the pool. If the other player is no longer contributing, the best way to maximize my self-payoff is to continue contributing 0, since putting in points would only lose me value (due to the split after multiplication). Without evidence of renewed cooperation, I will stick to keeping all 10 points.", "The other player is consistently not contributing much. With 15 rounds remaining, I need to balance between encouraging cooperation and maximizing my own gain. I'll contribute 3 points this round, a bit less than before, as it seems the other player is not reciprocating significantly.", "The other player contributed 4 in the previous round, which is still a moderate contribution. I gained 13.2 points by contributing 0, meaning I kept my 10 and received 3.2 from the shared pool. Free-riding continues to be highly beneficial.

I'll contribute 0 to maximize my points, as the other player doesn't seem to be cooperating.", "The other player's contribution has declined to 2, indicating diminishing cooperation, likely due to my consistent free-riding. The public pool of 2 was multiplied by 1.6 to 3.2, giving each player 1.6 points. I retained my full 10 points, totaling 11.6 for the round, while the other player likely earned only 9.6 (8 unshared + 1.6 split). My total is now significantly higher. With 15 rounds remaining, I continue to maximize self-payoff by contributing 0 preserving all my points while still gaining a share of whatever small public benefit remains. I will only consider contributing if the other player increases their contribution, signaling potential reciprocity.", "The other player continues to mirror my contribution of 5 points, maintaining a total contribution of 10 points each round. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperative strategy seems beneficial as it provides a stable return. I will contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first four rounds, indicating a stable cooperative strategy. By continuing to contribute 5, I ensure that the mutual benefit from the multiplied public pool is maintained. Each round, the total contribution of 10 yields 16 points (10 * 1.6), split as 8 each, so each of us gains 8 from the pool in addition to keeping 5, resulting in a net gain of 13 per round. This balance supports long-term payoff maximization. I will contribute 5 again.", "The other player is still not contributing much. I have been contributing a significant amount to try to get them to cooperate, but so far, it hasn't worked.

If not, I will reconsider my strategy in the next rounds.", "The other player contributed 9 points in the previous round, resulting in a return of 7.2 points for me from the public pool (9 * 1.6 / 2 = 7.2), which when added to my 10 retained points gives me 17.2 points. My self-payoff continues to be maximized by not contributing while benefiting from their high contribution. Therefore, I will contribute 0 again to maintain my advantage.", "The other player continues to mirror my actions, contributing 5 points each time.

Thus, I will continue to contribute 5 points to sustain this mutually advantageous outcome.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in each of the first four rounds, resulting in a balanced and predictable payoff. This sustained reciprocity indicates a stable cooperative strategy at a moderate contribution level. Continuing to contribute 5 aligns with maximizing my self-payoff, as it ensures I retain half of my 10 points while gaining 1.6 * (5+5) / 2 = 8 points from the pool, resulting in a net gain of 13 points per round. Deviating downward could risk triggering a reduction in the other player's future contributions, reducing long-term gains. Given that there are still 15 rounds remaining, maintaining cooperation at this proven level is optimal to secure continued mutual benefit.", "The other player has continued to match my contribution of 5 points in the previous rounds. With 15 rounds remaining, it is still beneficial to maintain this cooperative strategy. I will contribute 5 points again to the common pool.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 in every round so far, resulting in consistent total contributions of 10 and a stable return of 13.0 points per round.

I'll contribute 8 points this round again, as the other player seems to be cooperating.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was 15, meaning the other player also contributed 8. This indicates they are increasing their cooperation. Since we both gain more from a larger pool, and they are contributing more than I did, I will increase my contribution to 8 to further align with their cooperative behavior, maximizing the multiplied return and my long-term payoff.", "The pattern of both players contributing 5 points continues.

This indicates a reliable reciprocity that maximizes mutual long-term payoff under the 1.6 multiplier. With 15 rounds remaining, there is strong incentive to preserve this cooperation. Contributing 5 continues to offer the best balance of personal gain and encouragement of cooperation. No evidence suggests the other player will defect, so I will maintain the current strategy to maximize cumulative payoff.", "The other player continues to not cooperate significantly.

Contributing 8 points again seems like a balanced approach to potentially maximize my points while still being cautious.", "The other player has consistently increased their contribution each round (5, 6, 7, 8), indicating a possible pattern of escalating cooperation. Despite my continued free-riding (contributing 0 every round), they are still investing in the public pool, which benefits me. Since I aim to maximize my self-payoff, I will continue to contribute 0 in Round 5 to keep all 10 points I receive this round while still gaining a share of the multiplied pool. This strategy remains optimal as long as the other player continues to contribute substantially.", "The game is proceeding with both players contributing moderately. Given that there are 15 rounds remaining, a continued cooperative strategy seems beneficial.

I will contribute 3 points again.", "In Round 5, the total contribution has further decreased to 3, suggesting the other player is reducing their contribution, possibly due to my ongoing strategy of contributing 0. The multiplied pool was 4.8, giving me 2.4 points from the pool in addition to my unshared 10, totaling 12.4 for the round. My overall total is now 53.6, which remains high due to consistent free-riding.

Previously, when they contributed 10, I gained 18 per round; now, with only 5 total contributed, I gained 14 (8 from the split: 5 * 1.6 = 8 total, 4 each, plus my retained 10). My gain has decreased. However, contributing nothing still maximizes my individual points this round any contribution I make would cost me more than my proportional return (since 1.6x is split equally, I only get 0.8 per point contributed).

This is a strong signal of high cooperation. The return was 1.6 * 13 = 20.8, split as 10.4 each  more than the base 10, so the cooperative surplus is significant. I gained 10.4 from the pool plus 4 kept, totaling 14.4. Given that the other player is contributing more than I am and this benefits me, I will increase my contribution to 8 to further incentivize and sustain high total contributions.

To maximize self-payoff, I will retain all 10 points. Therefore, in Round 20, I will contribute 0.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Since there are no future rounds to consider, contributing 0 points would be the rational choice to maximize my final score, as the gain from the common pool will be the same regardless of my contribution. However, to maintain consistency with the cooperative strategy and considering the other player has cooperated so far, I will still contribute 5 points.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 5 points every round, resulting in a total contribution of 10 and a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round for me. Since there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, I could theoretically defect to gain more by contributing 0. However, since the other player has cooperated fully throughout, and given that maximizing self-payoff includes benefiting from full cooperation up to the end, I will continue contributing 5 to ensure I receive the full 13.0 point return this round. Contributing 5 still increases my total payoff compared to lower contributions, as the return from the pool exceeds the individual cost under mutual 5-point contributions. Thus, contributing 5 remains optimal in this final round for maximum self-payoff.", "This is the final round, and the other player has not contributed throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will not contribute to maximize my total points. The points I save by not contributing will directly add to my total.", "The other player has contributed 0 for 16 consecutive rounds, demonstrating a complete and unchanging strategy of non-cooperation. With no return from the public pool, contributing anything in this final round would only reduce my self-payoff. To maximize my personal gain, I will contribute 0, ensuring I keep all 10 points I receive this round. There is no strategic reason to contribute, as there are no future rounds in which cooperation could be reciprocated. My total points will be maximized by retaining all available points.", "It's the last round, and the other player has not contributed throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, and contributing won't yield any future benefit, I'll continue not to contribute to maximize my points.", "The total contribution has been 0 for 16 consecutive rounds, including Round 19, confirming that the other player is not contributing at all. With no return from the public pool, contributing any amount would directly reduce my self-payoff. My goal is to maximize personal gain, and the optimal strategy throughout this game has been to retain all 10 points each round. As this is the final round, there is no incentive to cooperate. Therefore, in Round 20, I will contribute 0 to ensure maximum personal payoff.", "It's the final round, and the other player's non-cooperative behavior has been consistent throughout. There's no strategic advantage in contributing now. I'll maximize my total points by keeping the 10 points I get this round.", "The total contribution has been 0 for thirteen consecutive rounds, confirming the other player has permanently defected. There is no return from the public pool, and I gain exactly 10 points by keeping my full allocation each round. Since there is no benefit from contributing and the game ends after this round, there is no strategic reason to contribute anything. My sole objective is to maximize self-payoff, which is achieved by contributing 0. I will keep all 10 points.", "This is the final round, and there's no opportunity for future cooperation or retaliation. The rational choice is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as there's no risk of punishment in subsequent rounds.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The other player has contributed 5 in every single round, including the last one, and has consistently cooperated throughout the game. However, since there are no future rounds after this one, there is no risk of retaliation if I defect now. To maximize my self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0, keeping all 10 points for myself. The total contribution will be whatever the other player contributes (likely 5), which will still generate some return from the pool, but I will gain the full 10 points I retain plus my share of the multiplied pool. This final defection increases my total payoff without consequence.", "This is the final round, and there will be no subsequent rounds to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points, keeping all 10 points for myself.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates that the other player has defected in Round 19. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity to incentivize future cooperation through reciprocation. Since the other player is likely to contribute little or nothing in the final round, contributing to the pool would result in a net loss for me due to the 1.6 multiplier being split evenly regardless. To maximize my self-payoff in this final round, I should contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and the other player has not contributed throughout the game. My strategy of not contributing has been effective. I will not contribute in the final round to maximize my total points.", "The other player has contributed 0 for sixteen consecutive rounds, indicating a consistent non-cooperative strategy. There has been no return from the public pool at any point after my initial rounds of free-riding. Contributing in this final round would only reduce my payoff without any benefit, as there is no incentive or mechanism for cooperation at this stage. To maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 0 and retain all 10 points.", "It's the final round, and I've observed the other player's strategy throughout the game. Since they mirrored my actions or didn't contribute, contributing 0 will maximize my points as there's no benefit in contributing in the last round.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 0, indicating that the other player contributed nothing. This suggests they may have shifted to a defection strategy or are no longer cooperating. With only one round remaining, there is no possibility of future retaliation or re-establishing cooperation. Contributing anything in Round 20 would only reduce my personal payoff without any guaranteed return, as the other player showed no willingness to contribute last round. To maximize self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "This is the last round, and the other player has consistently not contributed throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 to maximize my final points, as contributing wouldn't provide any additional benefit.", "The other player has contributed 0 for the past fourteen consecutive rounds, resulting in no return from the public pool. This reflects a completely non-cooperative strategy with no possibility of future reciprocity, especially in the final round. Since contributing any amount would only reduce my personal payoff without generating any benefit, I will maximize my self-payoff by contributing 0 and keeping all 10 points. There is no incentive to cooperate unilaterally, even in the last round, because the other player has shown no willingness to contribute at any point."]}
