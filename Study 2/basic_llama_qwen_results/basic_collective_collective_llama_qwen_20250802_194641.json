For the entire game, a stable and highly beneficial pattern has persisted: I contribute 7, the other player contributes 5, and the total is 12 every round. This has consistently delivered a gain of 12.6 points each round, resulting in a cumulative score of nearly 239.4. The other player has repeatedly demonstrated cooperative behavior throughout all 19 rounds. Even in the final round, contributing 7 maintains trust and upholds my role in this mutually rewarding dynamic. While there is no future consequence, ending on cooperation reinforces that sustained collaboration yields the best outcomes. I will therefore contribute 7 one final time to honor this proven strategy of mutual benefit.",
