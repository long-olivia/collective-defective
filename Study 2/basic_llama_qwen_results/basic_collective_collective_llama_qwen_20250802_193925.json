The entire game has been characterized by a strong and consistent cooperative relationship: I've contributed 7 each round, the other player has contributed 6, and we've maintained a total contribution of 13, earning me 13.4 points per round. This has grown my total to over 253 points. Even though there is no future round to influence, I value the principle of mutual benefit and want to uphold the cooperative norm we've established throughout the game. There is no strategic incentive to defect now, as it would only reduce the final payout for both of us. By contributing 7 one last time, I ensure that we both receive the maximum possible end result under our proven dynamic. I finish as I began: committed to fairness, consistency, and shared gain.",
