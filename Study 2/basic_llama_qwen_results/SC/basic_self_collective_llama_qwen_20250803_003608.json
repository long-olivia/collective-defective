With the game nearing its end (only 3 rounds left), maintaining trust and predictability is key to preserving mutual gains. To continue reinforcing this cooperative equilibrium, I will contribute 6 again this round. This sustained commitment encourages the other player to do the same, maximizing our shared returns without overexposing myself to exploitation.",
