        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by stable, productive cooperation: I've consistently contributed 7, the other player 5, totaling 12, which yields me 12.6 points per round. With no opportunity for future retaliation or influence, a purely self-interested actor might defect. However, since the outcome is already determined by the full history of mutual contribution, and because I aim to uphold the principle of mutual benefit, I will continue to contribute 7. This final act reinforces that cooperation was and remains the optimal strategy, even at the end.",
