This has delivered a reliable 12.6-point gain for me every time. Even in these final stages, mutual cooperation remains the best strategy to maximize cumulative earnings. There is no sign that the other player will defect, so unilaterally reducing my contribution now would needlessly break trust and risk retaliation in the last rounds, reducing overall payoff. The incentives still favor continued cooperation. To preserve the proven equilibrium and secure maximum returns until the end, I will contribute 7 once again.",
