In all recent rounds, the total contribution has been 16, with both players contributing 8. This shows a stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium has formed. Since there is no future round to punish or reward beyond this point, the incentive is to preserve trust and ensure we both finish strong. Defecting now would only hurt mutual returns without gain, as we split the pool equally. Therefore, I will contribute 8 again to uphold our established cooperation and maximize the final shared benefit, ending on a note of mutual advantage.",
