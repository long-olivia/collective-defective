The other player likely kept all 10 of their points from that round, gaining 4 (from the pool) + 10 (kept) = 14, which is more than my gain, but at the cost of breaking cooperation.

Since the other player did not attempt to re-engage or contribute anything, it suggests either a willingness to defect consistently or a reactive strategy like mine. I now recognize that rebuilding cooperation requires a signal. While prudence is justified, perpetual defection leads to lower long-term gains. I will attempt to restore cooperation by contributing 5 this round a moderate, trust-building amount. This invites collaboration without overexposing myself.

I will continue contributing 6 to uphold my role as a cooperative but fair player, ensuring that the benefits of the public pool continue to flow for both of us in this final round.", "The cooperative strategy has been consistently successful over 20 rounds. To maintain the mutual benefit and continue the established pattern, I will contribute 5 points again.", "After 19 rounds of unwavering cooperation, with both players consistently contributing 5 and achieving a total pool of 10 each time, we have established a highly reliable and rewarding pattern. This has yielded a steady 13.0 points per round, totaling 247.0 points accumulated so far. As we reach Round 20, maintaining my contribution at 5 continues to honor and reinforce this successful cooperative relationship. There is no incentive to deviate, as cooperation maximizes mutual gain and preserves trust. I will contribute 5 once again."]}
