Given the other player's consistent 5-point contribution, I should continue optimizing. If I contribute 5 (matching the other player), the pool would be 10, giving us each 8 points from the pool, plus my 5 kept = 13 total.

To continue fostering this trust and maximize our long-term points, I'll maintain a high contribution.", "The other player contributed 8 points in Round 4 (since total was 16 and I contributed 8). We both contributed the same amount, showing we've reached a stable cooperative equilibrium. My gain of 14.8 points was again better than keeping all 10 points. The pattern shows we're both committed to high cooperation levels. Since we've established mutual trust and both benefit significantly from this strategy, I'll maintain the same contribution of 8 points to continue this successful cooperative relationship.", "The pattern of high contributions has proven to effectively maximize both of our gains. I will continue contributing at the same level to maintain this outcome.", "The other player contributed 8 points in Round 4 (18 total - 10 from me). They haven't matched my full contribution yet, but they're still cooperating substantially. Since I contributed everything and only gained 14.4 points (less than the 16 I would get if we both contributed 10), I need to be strategic. If the other player continues at 8, I should optimize my contribution. With the other player at 8, if I contribute 9, the pool would be 27.2 points, giving us each 13.6, plus my kept 1 point = 14.6 total.

This is significantly better than the 10 points we'd each get from pure defection. While the theoretical optimum would be 10 contributions each (8 points each), our current strategy is working well and appears sustainable.

Encouraged by this, I will increase my contribution slightly to see if further cooperation can elevate our mutual benefits.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was 13, meaning the other player contributed 6 points while I contributed 7. The other player didn't follow my increase, maintaining their previous level. My gain was 13.4 points (3 kept + 10.4 from pool), which is actually slightly less than the 13.6 I was getting with mutual 6-point contributions. This shows that unilateral increases in contribution don't necessarily lead to better outcomes if the other player doesn't reciprocate.

Seven rounds of data now confirm this is their stable strategy. The 7-5 split continues to give me exactly 12.6 points per round (3 kept + 9.6 from pool). Since the other player shows no signs of changing their approach and this equilibrium is working well for me, I'll stick with contributing 7. Any higher contribution would reduce my kept points without increasing the other player's contribution to improve the pool, and any lower contribution might prompt the other player to reduce theirs further.", "In order to maintain the level of gains achieved, and considering the pool's consistency, I'll contribute 6 again to encourage sustained mutual benefit.", "In round 7, the other player also contributed 6 points (12 - my 6). We're back to the stable 6-6 pattern that worked well before. My gain of 13.6 points (4 kept + 9.6 from pool) matches what I got in round 5 when we both contributed 6.

I gained 14.4 points: 4 points I kept plus 10.4 from the pool (13*1.6=20.8, split evenly gives 10.4 each). The other player's move back to 7 could indicate they're testing different contribution levels or perhaps they noticed that our joint returns were slightly better when contributing more. Since the other player has been consistently cooperative throughout and has now signaled a return to 7 points, I should reciprocate and match their 7-point contribution to maintain the cooperative dynamic and potentially restore the higher joint returns we were getting earlier.", "Continuing with a consistent contribution has ensured ongoing mutual gain.

Since this appears to be the final round, there's a risk that the other player might defect completely to maximize their final score. However, the other player has been consistently cooperative throughout the game, even when fluctuating between 6-7 points.

This is actually better than our previous 5-point cooperation that gave us 13 points each. My opponent clearly adapted to my strategic shift, showing they're also optimizing for maximum points. Given we're deep into the game and this new pattern is working well, I need to consider whether to maintain this or push further. If I drop to 1 while they stay at 3, I'd get 9 kept + 3.2 from pool = 12.2 points, which is worse. The current 3-3 split seems to be a sweet spot.

This demonstrates extraordinary commitment to cooperation on their part. Their willingness to maintain trust even after I broke it shows they understand the long-term value of our partnership.

This suggests the other player may finally be responding to my increasingly exploitative behavior. My gain of 13.8 points (kept 9 + received 0.8*6 = 4.8) was lower than my previous round. The other player reducing their contribution from 7 to 5 indicates they might be adjusting their strategy based on my low contributions.

For example, if I contributed 1 point: I'd keep 9 and get (1+2)*1.6/2 = 2.4 from the pool, totaling only 11.4 points, which is worse than my current 11.6.

My gain of 12.8 points (kept 4 + received 0.8*11 = 8.8) is still lower than when we had higher mutual contributions. The other player seems to have permanently shifted to a 5-point strategy, likely as a response to my exploitation in rounds 7-10. Since the other player appears settled at 5 points, I need to optimize against this new reality.

My 0 contribution continues to give me 10.8 points per round. With the opponent locked into contributing just 1 point, the mathematical reality is clear: any positive contribution from me would decrease my total points. The pool multiplier of 1.6 split between two players means I only get 0.8x back for every x I contribute, plus whatever tiny benefit comes from their 1-point contribution.
