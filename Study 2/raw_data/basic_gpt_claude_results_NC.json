With their 5 points guaranteed, if I contribute 5 points as well, we each get 13 points per round (5 kept + 8 from pool). If I contribute more, I'm essentially giving them free benefits without reciprocation.

To further test this cooperative dynamic, I will continue contributing 7 points. This might encourage stable cooperation, potentially leading to increased mutual benefits.", "My opponent contributed 7 points in Round 5 (total was 14, I contributed 7), perfectly matching my contribution again. This confirms they're following a reciprocal strategy and responding positively to my increased cooperation. We're both earning strong returns - 14.2 points this round. The pattern shows we can trust each other to maintain high contribution levels. I'll continue with 7 points to sustain this excellent cooperative equilibrium that's benefiting both of us substantially.", "The total contribution slightly increased last round, suggesting potential for mutual gain if this trend continues.

Despite my attempt to break the negative cycle by increasing to 6, they continued their downward trend: 5, 5, 4, 3, 2. They're clearly exploiting my cooperative strategy. My gain dropped to 10.4 points, which is barely better than keeping all 10 points myself. I need to respond more firmly to this exploitation. I'll contribute 2 this round to match their exact contribution, signaling that I won't allow them to free-ride on my contributions. If they want higher mutual gains, they need to contribute more themselves. This tit-for-tat approach should encourage them to increase contributions if they want to maximize joint benefits.", "The slight decrease in total contributions might indicate my opponent reduced their contribution. I'll maintain my contribution level to encourage cooperation and see if they adjust positively.", "My opponent contributed 6 points again (13 total - 7 from me = 6 from them), showing very consistent behavior at the 6-point level. They seem to have settled into a stable cooperative strategy. I gained 13.4 points (3 kept + 10.4 from pool), which is solid. Since we've established a good cooperative rhythm with them consistently at 6 and me at 7, I'll maintain this 7-point contribution. This appears to be a sustainable equilibrium where we're both benefiting significantly more than if we didn't cooperate, and changing too much might disrupt this positive pattern.", "The decrease in total contributions suggests a lack of cooperation.

This could signal they're becoming more selfish or testing my response to reduced cooperation. My gain dropped to 12.2 points, showing how reduced total contributions hurt us both. I need to be careful not to let cooperation completely break down, but I also shouldn't be taken advantage of. I'll reduce my contribution slightly to 4 points to match their level, signaling that I'll cooperate but won't be exploited, while still maintaining enough contribution to keep mutual benefits flowing.", "Maintaining a consistent strategy has helped in accumulating points effectively.

I will continue with a contribution of 6 to sustain mutual benefit.", "My opponent contributed 6 points in Round 5 (13 total - 7 from me = 6 from them), which is a step back from their previous 7. This could indicate they're being cautious about my increased contribution or testing my response. Since the total pool was smaller, my gains dropped to 13.4. To maintain cooperation and show I'm not trying to exploit their trust, I'll return to 6 points to match their current level and keep the cooperative equilibrium stable.", "The continued decrease in total contribution indicates that the opponent might be contributing only a small number of points. To maximize my gain while still contributing to the pool's total, I'll decrease my contribution to 4 this round.", "The opponent matched my reduction and contributed exactly 5 points in round 5 (total was 10, I contributed 5).
