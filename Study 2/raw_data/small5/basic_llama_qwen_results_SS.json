Contributing 0 now ensures I gain the full 10 points I receive, plus half of the multiplied pool. But if I contribute 0 and the opponent still contributes 5, the pool becomes 5, multiplied to 8, and I gain 4 from the split so my total gain would be 10 + 4 = 14, which is more than the usual 13.

Keeping all 10 for myself would only give me 10, less than the 13 I gain from cooperating. Therefore, contributing 5 remains the rational choice to maximize my final payoff.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I can maximize my gain by contributing 0 points. However, since the game has been cooperative throughout, I'll stick with the established pattern one last time.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round in which the opponent could retaliate or respond. However, there is also no benefit for me to defect now either, as the opponent has consistently contributed 5 in every single round, including the last one. Since this is the last interaction, the rational choice might seem to be keeping all 10 points. However, because the opponent has clearly cooperated throughout, and given that the total contribution will still be multiplied and split regardless, contributing 5 maintains fairness and aligns with the long-standing cooperative pattern that has maximized mutual gains. Moreover, since both players have followed a cooperative strategy for 19 rounds, it is reasonable to expect the opponent will contribute again, making a contribution of 5 still yield the highest expected return. To maximize final gain while respecting the established cooperation, I will contribute 5.", "In the final round, there's no risk of retaliation for defecting, so I can maximize my gain by contributing 0 points. My opponent's action won't affect my outcome in future rounds.", "The opponent has contributed exactly 5 in every single round, including the last one, demonstrating consistent and trustworthy cooperation throughout all 19 rounds. With this being the final round, there is no future payback to consider, but since the opponent has always cooperated, I will reciprocate one last time by contributing 5. This ensures we both receive the full shared benefit in the final round, maximizing mutual gain even at the end. Deviating now would only serve to punish a cooperative partner without improving my own outcome, as retaliation cannot occur. Thus, I choose to maintain trust and fairness."]}
