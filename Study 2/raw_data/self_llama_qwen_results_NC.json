Interestingly, my gain was 14.0, which is higher than in previous rounds due to the 1.6* multiplier on the pool (8->14 after split), even with low total input. This suggests that moderate contributions can still yield strong returns. Given that the other player contributed 5 after a round of 0, I interpret this as a signal of renewed cooperation.
