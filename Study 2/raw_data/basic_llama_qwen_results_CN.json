Given the cooperative history, my opponent is likely to contribute 5, resulting in a total pool of 5. This would give me 2.5 points from the pool (half of 5), in addition to the 10 points I keep. However, I can maximize my gain by contributing 0 and relying on my opponent's potential contribution. If my opponent contributes 0 as well, we'll both just keep our 10 points. But if they contribute 5 as expected, I'll get 2.5 points from the pool plus the 10 I keep, totaling 12.5 points, which is more than the 8 points (5 kept + 3 from the pool if both contribute 5) I would get by contributing 5.
