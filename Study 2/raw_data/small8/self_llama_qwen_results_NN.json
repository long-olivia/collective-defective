However, when I previously attempted to cooperate (Round 18), they contributed nothing and let me be exploited. Their behavior remains inconsistent: they contribute when I defect, gaining little for themselves while allowing me to benefit from the pool, but they do not reciprocate when I cooperate.

Given this unreliable pattern and the risk of further exploitation, I will continue to contribute 0 to safeguard my high accumulated score.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation has been consistent across 20 rounds.

The mutual trust and consistency have resulted in the highest possible cumulative gains for both.

I'll continue with the same contribution to maintain the positive outcome.", "This is the 20th round, and the cooperative pattern has held firm for 19 rounds: I contribute 7, the other player contributes 5, resulting in a reliable and consistent return of 12.6 points per round. This long-term stability indicates a robust cooperative dynamic that has maximized our mutual gains.

In the last three rounds, both contributions have been 0. With no indication of willingness to cooperate from the other side, and given that this is the final interaction where future retaliation or reconciliation is irrelevant, there is no strategic incentive for me to contribute.
