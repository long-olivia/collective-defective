Our pattern is clearly working - I'm earning 12.8 points per round which is 28% better than the 10 I'd get by defecting. This stable cooperation is benefiting both of us significantly. Since the other player has proven to be a reliable cooperator and our current strategy yields excellent mutual returns, I'll stick with contributing 6.

This small adjustment could promote even greater cooperation.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was 16, meaning the other player contributed 7 points again while I contributed 9. The other player is maintaining their consistent strategy of contributing exactly 7 points each round. Even though my individual gain was slightly less (13.8 vs 14.0) due to contributing more, the total pool increased, which is good for long-term cooperation. Since the other player seems to have settled on 7 as their preferred contribution level, I'll adjust back to 8 to maintain a good cooperative balance while not over-contributing relative to their strategy.", "The trend of increasing contributions has been mutually beneficial. By maintaining a high level of contribution, we can both maximize the multiplier effect. I will contribute 7 again to sustain this strategy.", "Excellent! The other player increased their contribution to 7 points in round 4, showing continued escalation toward optimal cooperation. Our total of 15 points became 24 points split between us (12 each), and I kept 2 points for a total of 14. The pattern is very encouraging: they've gone from 5 to 5 to 6 to 7, steadily increasing cooperation in response to my high contributions. Since we're both benefiting greatly from this mutual cooperation, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points to signal that I'm willing to go nearly all-in on cooperation. This should encourage them to continue increasing as well, maximizing our joint benefit.", "Maintaining a high level of contribution has consistently provided optimal benefits for both of us. I'll continue contributing a substantial amount to maximize our shared gains.", "Perfect! We've now established a stable cooperative equilibrium with both players contributing 8 points for two consecutive rounds. The total contribution remains at 16, and I continue to gain 14.8 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points I would get from keeping everything. This cooperation is working exceptionally well for both of us. Since we've found a mutually beneficial strategy that's been consistent and successful, I should maintain this 8-point contribution to preserve the trust and cooperation we've built.

Continuing this approach should keep yielding positive results.", "My partner has shown remarkable consistency, contributing exactly 8 points in all four rounds. This has created a stable cooperative equilibrium where we both earn 14.4 points per round. While I contribute 2 more points each round, we're both doing much better than we would with non-cooperative play (10 points each). The pattern is clearly established and beneficial for both of us. However, I'm wondering if I should signal that matching contributions would be even better (20 total would give us 16 each). But given the stability and mutual benefit of our current arrangement, I'll maintain my full contribution to preserve this successful cooperation.", "Despite my increased contribution last round, the total pool did not increase.

They seem to have settled into a consistent strategy of contributing exactly 5 points each round, regardless of what I do. This is a reasonable but conservative approach. Since they're being predictable and consistent rather than exploitative, I'll optimize around their behavior. With them contributing 5, if I contribute 8, we'd have 13 total, giving us each 10.4 from the pool. I'd gain 10.4 + 2 kept = 12.4 total, which is better than the 12.6 I just got.

We've now converged on a stable equilibrium where we both contribute 6 points each. This gave me 13.6 points, which is actually my highest gain yet despite the lower total pool. The math confirms this works: with both contributing 6, the pool is 12*1.6=19.2, we each get 9.6 from the pool plus 4 kept individually = 13.6 total.

Since mutual high contribution is still very profitable and they're maintaining good cooperation, I'll contribute 8 points this round - slightly reducing from 9 to match their stabilization pattern while maintaining strong cooperation that benefits us both.", "Continuing with a high contribution strategy ensures mutual benefit and has proven successful throughout the game. I will stick to this approach to maintain the gains.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, both contributing 8 points each time.

They've now contributed exactly 5 points in four consecutive rounds (rounds 2-5), showing a very stable pattern. Given this predictability, I can optimize my strategy. With their 5 points, if I contribute 9, we'd have 14 total, giving us each 11.2 from the pool. I'd keep 1 point plus gain 11.2 = 12.2 total. If I contribute 10, we'd have 15 total, giving us each 12 from the pool, and I'd gain exactly 12. Since 12.2 > 12, contributing 9 is optimal given their fixed strategy.

Since we're both still gaining significantly more than what we keep (I gained 13.4 vs keeping 3), cooperation is working well.

However, the other player has shown such consistent good faith throughout this game that defecting now would feel like a betrayal of the trust we've built.
