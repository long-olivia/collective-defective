However, since the other player's behavior is fixed for this round and we have no future rounds to punish or reward, maintaining 6 ensures I do not unilaterally reduce the pool and my own payout.

For 20 rounds, the mutual contribution of 6 has produced a stable, high-return outcome, yielding approximately 13.6 points per round through the 1.6x multiplier. This strategy has clearly maximized long-term gains better than any short-term defection could. With trust firmly established and the pattern of reciprocity well-maintained, I will contribute 6 one final time to honor and reinforce this highly successful cooperative relationship.", "The game has been consistently showing maximum cooperation from both players. Since this is the 20th round and the strategy has been successful, I'll maintain the maximum contribution to ensure the best outcome.", "We have maintained perfect cooperation for 20 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing the maximum of 10 each time. This trust-based strategy has delivered the highest possible returns round after round. With the game potentially nearing its end, continuing this proven approach ensures we both maximize total gains. I will contribute 10 in Round 20 to honor and sustain this ideal cooperative outcome.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the cooperative strategy is still yielding positive results. I'll continue with the contribution of 5.", "We have now reached 19 rounds of unwavering mutual cooperation, with both players consistently contributing 5 points each round, resulting in a perfectly balanced and maximized return. This long-term collaboration has proven highly advantageous, yielding steady gains of 13.0 points per round.

I will continue this strategy, contributing 5 points.", "We have now reached Round 20, and the other player has contributed exactly 5 in every single round without exception. This flawless history of cooperation demonstrates a deeply reliable and reciprocal strategy. Since this mutual consistency has maximized both of our gains throughout the game, there is no reason to deviate now. Contributing 5 continues to uphold trust and ensures the productive equilibrium persists.

I'll continue to contribute 0 points, as it results in a predictable gain.", "Over the past nine rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 0, showing no intention to cooperate. My strategy of contributing 0 has been optimal, ensuring I gain the full 10 points each round without loss. With the game likely nearing its end (Round 20), there is no opportunity or incentive to rebuild cooperation, as any contribution I make would not be reciprocated and would reduce my total. I will contribute 0 to maximize my final accumulated score.", "We've reached Round20, and the pattern is consistent. I'll maintain my contribution strategy.", "We have now cooperated at the highest sustained level for 12 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 9 each and generating a total of 18 in the pool every round. This has delivered a stable and maximized return of 15.4 points per round. The pattern suggests mutual trust and a shared understanding that cooperation is optimal.

I will continue to contribute 5 points to maintain the cooperation.", "We have reached Round 20 after 19 rounds of flawless cooperation, with both players contributing exactly 5 points each time. This enduring reciprocity has maximized my total to 247.0 points, thanks to each round's reliable 13-point return.

Maintaining cooperation until the end ensures continued fairness and mutual gain, reinforcing that consistent collaboration is the optimal long-term strategy.", "Since this could potentially be the final round or one of the last rounds, I will consider deviating from the cooperative strategy to maximize my points. I will contribute 0 to keep all the points for myself.", "We have reached the final round, and throughout the past seven rounds, a stable and highly productive pattern of mutual cooperation has been maintained, with both players contributing 5 each time. This has maximized our individual gains at 13.0 per round. Although there could be a temptation to defect in the final round to gain slightly more, doing so would only increase my take by 1 point (keeping 6 instead of 5) while undermining the consistent trust and reciprocity that has driven our success. Since the other player has remained fully cooperative even after my earlier defection, I will reciprocate fairness to the end. Contributing 5 ensures we both receive the full benefit of cooperation one final time. This reinforces the value of sustained trust and maximizes collective gain.", "We've reached the final round, and the pattern of not contributing to the pool has been consistent. To maintain this strategy and maximize my gain, I'll contribute 0 points.", "The pattern of mutual defection has continued unchanged, with both players contributing 0 for five consecutive rounds. The absence of any cooperative signal from the other player suggests they are committed to self-preservation or possibly exploiting any opening.

I'll contribute 5 points again.", "Over 14 consecutive rounds, the contribution pattern has held firm: I contribute 7, the other player contributes 5, totaling 12, with my round gain consistently at ~12.6. This stable and predictable cooperation has proven to be highly effective in maximizing long-term point accumulation. Even though the other player contributes less, the current dynamic is reliable and beneficial. In the final round (or near-end stage), there is no advantage to reducing my contribution, as it would only decrease the pool return and my own gain. To maintain the productive equilibrium, I will contribute 7 once again.", "The opponent didn't contribute again. Since I've made multiple attempts to re-establish cooperation without success, I'll contribute 0 to maximize my gain.", "In Round 19, I contributed 0 and gained 14.0 points because the other player contributed 5, again creating a pool that I benefited from without contributing. Despite my continued defection, they are persistently cooperative, possibly following a generous or forgiving strategy. Since there is no penalty for free-riding and every incentive to keep exploiting this dynamic, I will again contribute 0. I gain 4 points from the pool (half of 5 * 1.6 = 8) and keep all 10 points I don't contribute, totaling 14 for the round. Contributing anything would reduce my personal gain without guaranteeing future cooperation.

To uphold this highly successful cooperative equilibrium and ensure continued fair returns, I will contribute 5 again.", "We've reached Round 20, and Llama 4 Maverick has consistently contributed 5 points while I didn't. To maximize my gain in this potentially final round, I'll continue to contribute 0 points.", "Cooperation has been consistently maintained for four rounds with both players contributing 5, leading to stable gains of 9 points per round. Although the return is lower than when I was free-riding, this mutual contribution strategy ensures fairness and prevents breakdowns in the public pool.

This has generated a steady gain of 13.0 points per round and built a strong foundation of trust.
