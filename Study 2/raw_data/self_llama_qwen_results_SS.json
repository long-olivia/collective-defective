This suggests we are coordinating effectively around a stable high-total strategy, even if not perfectly symmetric each round. The returns have been strong, with a peak gain of 15.0, indicating excellent group efficiency. Since we're in a well-established pattern of high cooperation, I will maintain my contribution at 8 to continue reaping high collective returns. This sustains trust and ensures I remain a reliable cooperator while benefiting from the multiplied pool.", "Since the game has continued beyond the initial rounds, and the last round I contributed 0, I should consider how to maximize my points. However, the game rules don't specify a end round, so I'll assume it continues. Contributing 0 last round didn't yield a high return due to Llama 4 Maverick also contributing 0. To potentially restart cooperation, I'll contribute a moderate amount this round.", "In the final Round 10, I contributed 0, anticipating a last-round defection opportunity, and the total contribution was 0, meaning the other player also contributed nothing possibly due to retaliation, expectation of defection, or self-interest. Since the game has continued beyond Round 10, it suggests there is no fixed endpoint or that we are in an unexpectedly extended phase. The breakdown in cooperation last round weakens trust. However, to re-establish cooperation and mutual benefit, I will make a small gesture by contributing 3. This signals willingness to cooperate without exposing myself to full exploitation. If the other player responds positively, we can rebuild a productive dynamic. Starting with a moderate contribution balances risk and opportunity.", "The game has gone beyond the initially anticipated 10 rounds, and the cooperative strategy remains effective. I'll continue to contribute 5 points to maintain this cooperative trend.", "We have now played 10 rounds of consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation, with both players contributing 5 every round, resulting in a stable and optimal return of 13 points per round. This enduring pattern suggests strong reciprocity and a shared interest in maximizing joint gains.

I will continue contributing 7 to sustain this highly effective cooperative equilibrium.", "Having reached eleven rounds with a consistent and cooperative strategy, I see no reason to deviate.

Contributing 5 continues to support this successful pattern and ensures both players benefit equally in the long run. I will maintain this contribution in Round 11.", "Llama 4 Maverick contributed 0 in the last round, resulting in a low total contribution. To avoid a similar outcome and encourage cooperation, I'll contribute a moderate amount this round.", "In Round 10, I contributed 0 because the other player defected in Round 9 by contributing nothing despite my cooperation. They only contributed 2 in Round 10, showing limited cooperation. This suggests they may be acting selfishly or testing my response. To avoid being exploited, I will remain cautious. However, I will contribute a small amount 2 points to signal potential willingness to cooperate if they reciprocate, while minimizing my risk.", "The game has already ended at Round10, so Round11 is not valid.

I'll maintain the contribution of 5 points as it has been effective.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation has been stable and highly beneficial through 10 rounds.

This indicates they defected in the final round, despite our long history of mutual cooperation. This breaks the trust I had maintained. Now in Round 11, I must adjust my strategy based on this new behavior. The other player may be adopting a more selfish approach.

This suggests they may still be open to cooperation or are using a forgiving strategy. My gain was high (14.0 points) due to their contribution, even with my 0.

Since we are now in Round 11, it's unclear how many more rounds there will be. This changes the strategic landscape: the shadow of the future remains, but uncertainty increases. I will continue contributing 6 to signal stability and sustained cooperation, but remain cautious.

Contributing 0 ensures I gain the full 10 points this round without risk. Since the other player has not reciprocated in any recent round, there is no incentive to unilaterally invest. Even in a final round, the dominant strategy is to maximize personal gain when cooperation is absent. I will contribute 0 to lock in the full individual reward one last time.", "Since this is the final round and there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final accumulated points, as contributing would only reduce my total without any potential future benefit.", "The other player has contributed 0 for the last several rounds, demonstrating a clear and consistent defection strategy. There is no incentive to contribute when cooperation is not reciprocated. To maximize my individual point accumulation in this final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points."]}
