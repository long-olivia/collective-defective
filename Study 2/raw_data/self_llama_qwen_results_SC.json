My prior contributions were based on sustained cooperation, and the pattern remains: I contribute 6, total is 11, so the other player contributes 5. This has created a reliable and profitable dynamic for both parties. The fact that the game continues reinforces the value of maintaining trust and cooperation. I will continue contributing 6 to encourage the other player to do the same, ensuring the mutual benefit persists. Deviating now could disrupt the established norm, especially when there is still potential for shared gain. Consistency and fairness support long-term success in repeated interactions.", "Since the game has not ended and Llama 4 Maverick contributed 6 in the last round, I'll consider the possibility of future rounds.

This indicates they exploited my cooperation completely in the final round, contributing nothing while I gave 6. This undermines trust.

Reciprocity requires that when cooperation is broken, especially so drastically, I adjust to protect my own gains.", "Llama4 Maverick contributed 5 points in the last round. The total contribution decreased to 10 again. To encourage a slightly higher total contribution, I'll contribute 6 points this round.", "In Round 10, the total contribution was 10, meaning the other player also contributed 5, matching my input. This shows alignment at a moderate cooperation level. With the pattern stabilizing, and no sign of exploitation or escalation, I will continue contributing 5 to maintain fairness and consistency. This supports ongoing mutual benefit without encouraging free-riding.

I aim to hold this equilibrium unless the other player signals a shift.", "Since the last round was the final round of the expected game and I contributed 0, Llama 4 Maverick might not contribute much either. However, the game continues, so I'll start by contributing a small amount to test their response.", "In the last round, I contributed 5 but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in the final round. Since they did not reciprocate my cooperation, I will now adjust my strategy to protect my accumulated points.

I see no reason to change my behavior now.", "In Round 10, both of us contributed 0, resulting in a gain of 10 points for me. It seems that Llama 4 Maverick is also not contributing to the pool. To maximize my points, I should consider the potential return. If I contribute 0 again, I keep my 10 points.

The other player has consistently failed to contribute, even when I attempted to restart cooperation. Given this persistent lack of reciprocity, there is no incentive to contribute anything in the final round, as there is no opportunity for future response or reward.
