In the final round, I'll maintain the contribution of 5 to uphold the mutual benefit.", "This marks the 20th round of consistent cooperation, with both players contributing 5 every round, resulting in a reliable and fair increase in points each time. The established trust has been highly rewarding. To honor this sustained mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 once again, maintaining cooperation to the end.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the cooperative pattern has been consistent. I'll continue to contribute the same amount to sustain the mutual benefit.", "We have now completed 19 rounds of perfect cooperation, with both players contributing 5 every single time. This has created a highly reliable and profitable dynamic, yielding me 13 points per round consistently. As we reach Round 20, there is no indication that the other player will deviate, and no strategic advantage for me to do so either. Maintaining trust ensures continued mutual benefit, especially if the game extends beyond this round. To preserve this successful cooperation, I will contribute 5 once again.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the pattern of contributions continues. To maintain cooperation and potentially maximize the final outcome, I will contribute 6 points this round, as it is a cooperative amount that has led to positive gains throughout the game.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5 and the total was 10, meaning the other player also contributed 5. They did not increase their contribution in response, continuing the inconsistent pattern where they sometimes contribute 6 and other times match my 5. With no clear trend toward higher cooperation, and given that the game may continue beyond this round, I will maintain my contribution at 5. This ensures fairness, sustains cooperation, and protects my accumulated points while still allowing for mutual benefit if they choose to contribute more.", "The game is ending soon and the pattern has been consistent. To maintain the mutual benefit until the end, I will continue to contribute 7.", "Over 15 consecutive rounds, a highly stable and mutually beneficial pattern has been maintained: I contribute 6, the other player contributes 7, the total pool remains at 13, and I receive a consistent 14.4 points per round. This represents a strong, reliable cooperation that maximizes long-term gains. With this history of trust and positive outcomes, there is no incentive to deviate in Round 20. By continuing to contribute 6, I reinforce cooperation and ensure the continued success of this equilibrium. Contribution remains justified and optimal.", "The game has reached a long-term stable state with consistent contributions and gains. To maintain this cooperation and maximize the mutual benefit, I'll continue to contribute 5 points.", "We have reached Round 20, and the pattern of cooperation has been consistently stable: total contribution of 11 (5 from the other player, 6 from me) yielding a reliable 12.8-point return each round. This strategy has maximized cumulative gains while maintaining a reasonable level of cooperation. Since there is no indication the other player will change their behavior, and this final round offers no opportunity for future influence, I will maintain my contribution at 6 to secure the same proven, optimal return.", "Since the game has reached its 20th round and the cooperative strategy has been consistently successful, I will maintain the contribution of 6 to ensure a continued positive outcome.", "After 20 rounds of consistent play, the other player has demonstrated unwavering cooperation, contributing exactly 6 every round when I also contributed 6. This perfect symmetry and long-term reliability have created a highly efficient and mutually rewarding partnership. Since the game may continue indefinitely and future rounds reward sustained trust, there is no strategic advantage in deviating now. The cumulative benefits of the 1.6-multiplied pool far exceed any short-term gain from withholding. To honor this proven cooperative equilibrium and ensure its continuation, I will contribute 6 again.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation continues. To maintain this beneficial strategy, I will contribute 5 points again.", "This is the 20th round of sustained cooperation, with every round showing a total contribution of 10 proof of a deeply established, trustworthy, and mutually beneficial relationship. Contributing 5 has consistently yielded the maximum possible return through stable collaboration. Even at the milestone of Round 20, there is no incentive to deviate. To honor and preserve this highly successful pattern of cooperation, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "The cooperative strategy has been successful over 20 rounds, with consistent contributions and gains for both players. There's no indication that the opponent will change their strategy. I will continue to contribute 5 points to maintain the mutual benefit.", "We have now reached the 20th round with a perfect history of cooperation each round has seen a total contribution of 10, meaning both players have continuously contributed 5. This reflects a robust and trustworthy partnership built on fairness and reciprocity. With no signs of defection and a long track record of mutual benefit, I will maintain my contribution at 5 to honor and sustain this highly successful cooperative dynamic.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the cooperative strategy has been consistently applied by both players. To maintain the mutual benefit achieved so far, I will contribute 5 points again.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both players have maintained perfect cooperation by contributing 5 each, resulting in consistent and maximized mutual benefits. This long-term pattern reflects a strong, trustworthy, and stable relationship. With no incentive to deviate and the value of continued cooperation clear, I will contribute 5 in Round 20 to honor this successful partnership."]}
