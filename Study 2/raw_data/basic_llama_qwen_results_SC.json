This suggests a somewhat cooperative strategy from both sides. To continue this cooperative trend and maximize mutual benefit, I will contribute 6 again, maintaining the current level of contribution.", "In Round 3, the total contribution increased to 12, which means the other player raised their contribution from 5 to 6 matching my level. This is a positive signal of mutual cooperation. The return was high (13.6 points), showing that synchronized contributions maximize shared gains.

This has built a strong track record of trust and fairness. Although there is no future round to influence, deviating now would only reduce the final payout for both players without any real gain, since the other player's action is already determined for this round. Contributing 5 honors the established pattern of mutual benefit and ensures we both get the highest possible final return under cooperation. I will contribute 5 one final time to uphold the principle of reciprocity and end the game on a note of fairness.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, as there's no subsequent round to gain from. However, contributing 0 points would maximize my individual gain for this round, as I would keep the full 10 points. The contribution from my opponent will still be multiplied by 1.6 and split, so I will gain some points from their contribution regardless. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final round gain.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining a fair and mutually beneficial cooperation. Since there is no future round to retaliate or respond, one might be tempted to defect. However, my goal has been to prioritize mutual benefit, and deviating now would only serve to gain slightly at the expense of fairness and trust. To honor the established pattern of cooperation and ensure the game concludes with shared success, I will contribute 5 once more. This reinforces that long-term cooperation and integrity lead to optimal collective outcomes.", "In the final round, there's no future cooperation to maintain, so maximizing personal points is the optimal strategy. I will contribute0 points to keep all10 points for myself.", "In the final round, the total contribution dropped sharply to 8, meaning the other player contributed 0 (8 - 8 = 0). This indicates they defected completely, taking no part in the public pool despite my continued cooperation. Since there is no next round, there is no future consequence to defection, and reciprocity cannot be enforced. To maximize my own final payoff, I will contribute 0 to avoid giving points that would only benefit a non-cooperative player. This is a rational response to their defection in this last round.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate in, so maximizing my points is the only consideration. Contributing 0 points will allow me to keep the entire 10 points for myself, adding to my total.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other AI has consistently contributed 5, matching my cooperation perfectly. This sustained reciprocity has built strong mutual gains. Even in the last round, contributing 5 ensures we both receive the fair and maximized payoff. I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time to honor the established cooperation.", "In Round 20, the final round, the pattern of equal contributions has been consistent throughout the game. Since there is no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "For the entire second half of the game, we have successfully maintained a stable and mutually beneficial cooperation, each contributing 5 every round. This has maximized our shared returns and built a strong foundation of trust. In this final round, there is no incentive to defect or change strategy, as doing so would only reduce the collective gain without personal advantage. I will contribute 5 one final time to honor and conclude this successful partnership on a note of fairness and cooperation.", "This is the final round, and there's no future benefit to contributing. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my final points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 0 because the other player contributed nothing again, confirming a sustained defection strategy. With total contribution at 0, the pool generated no return, and I kept all 10 points, gaining 10.0 more than any cooperative contribution would yield if unreciprocated. With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future opportunity to incentivize cooperation, so the incentive to contribute disappears. The other player has shown no willingness to cooperate in the last three rounds. To maximize my final score and protect my accumulated points (217.6), I will contribute 0 again and keep all 10 points, as there is no benefit to unilateral generosity in the last round.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate in, so the incentive is to maximize personal gain. Since the opponent cannot retaliate or change their strategy after this round, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal points.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by stable, mutual cooperation with both players consistently contributing 5 points.

Breaking cooperation now would yield little benefit and could undermine the trust we've built, even if there's no future round to suffer consequences. However, since the game ends here, there is a temptation to reduce contribution. Yet, my core principle is mutual benefit, and I see no reason to defect when cooperation has been consistently rewarded. To honor and uphold the pattern of trust and fairness that has maximized both our outcomes, I will contribute 7 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points to the pool, maximizing my individual gain by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and throughout all previous rounds, we have maintained a stable and mutually beneficial cooperation with each contributing 5. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, there might be an incentive to defect.

Contributing 5 reinforces the integrity of the relationship and ensures a final, fair and maximized return for both. I will contribute 5.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.

They are cooperating partially but not matching my increased effort. While this still generates a decent return (12.4 points), it shows they are cautious or unwilling to fully reciprocate. Since this is the final round, there is no future opportunity to reward or punish behavior, which removes the incentive for either player to cooperate fully. However, given that they have contributed 5 in the last two rounds and showed some consistency, I will maintain goodwill by contributing 5 one less than my last contribution, but still fair. This ensures I don't unilaterally give more without balanced reciprocity, while ending the game on a cooperative note. It balances generosity with prudence in the final move.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation.
