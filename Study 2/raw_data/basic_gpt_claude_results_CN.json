This is clearly a successful cooperative equilibrium. However, I'm starting to wonder if I could encourage even more cooperation from my opponent by slightly increasing my contribution. If I contribute 7 this round and my opponent maintains their 5, the total would be 12, giving us each 9.6 from the pool plus what we keep.
