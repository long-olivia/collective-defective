This suggests they may be hesitant to go higher or are testing my commitment. While I gained 13.8 points (1 kept + 12.8 from pool), the slight decrease in their contribution makes me want to be cautious about contributing my full 10. I'll maintain my contribution at 9 to show continued commitment to cooperation while not being overly aggressive, giving them a chance to match this level.", "The contributions have plateaued at 10, indicating that the other AI is maintaining a low contribution.

This is interesting - they increased their contribution when I decreased mine, suggesting they may be trying to maintain a stable total or encourage continued cooperation. I gained 14.4 points (10.4 from pool + 4 kept), which is excellent. The pattern shows we're both committed to cooperation, and they seem willing to compensate when I contribute less. I'll increase back to 7 to reciprocate their gesture and show I appreciate their cooperative spirit. This should help us maintain good mutual benefit.", "With the consistent decrease in total contributions, it seems like my opponent is prioritizing personal gain.

Changing now would risk breaking the trust we've established and harm both our long-term outcomes.", "The overall contribution dropped again, indicating the opponent might be contributing less. To adapt, I'll reduce my contribution slightly to 4 and see if that influences the total pool and return positively.", "My opponent also contributed 5 points in round 5 (10 total - 5 from me = 5 from them). We've now established a stable cooperative pattern where we both contribute 5 points each. I gained 13.0 points (5 kept + 8.0 from pool), which is still very good. This 5-5 split seems to be our equilibrium - we're both getting equal gains and showing equal commitment. I'll maintain this pattern by contributing 5 again, as it's proving mutually beneficial and demonstrates consistent cooperation. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this stable partnership should maximize our joint outcomes.", "Given the consistency in contributions and the success of the current strategy, it's advantageous to maintain my contribution level. This approach helps ensure continuous gains from the pool without risking too much of my own points.", "We've established an excellent cooperative pattern over 4 consecutive rounds with the opponent consistently contributing 6 and me contributing 7, resulting in 13 total contributions each round. This gives us both 13.4 points per round, which is 34% better than keeping all 10 points. The opponent has proven to be reliable and trustworthy. Since this strategy is working so well for both of us and we're in the middle of the game, I'll continue with 7 to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.", "The total contributions have stabilized, indicating a consistent cooperative behavior. I'll continue with my current contribution to maintain this cooperation pattern, maximizing mutual benefits.", "The opponent contributed 7 points again in round 5 (16 total - 9 mine = 7 theirs), maintaining the same level as round 4. They seem to have settled at 7 as their preferred contribution level. While this is still cooperative, they're not matching my escalation to 9. Since we're both benefiting well (I gained 13.8 points), I should consider adjusting my strategy. Contributing 9 while they contribute 7 means I'm being more generous than necessary. I'll reduce my contribution slightly to 8 to better match their commitment level while still maintaining strong cooperation.", "Continuing the strategy of contributing 5 points has consistently yielded positive returns in previous rounds, despite the consistently low total contributions. This stable approach allows me to benefit from the multiplier effect while maintaining a good balance of points for myself. Given that this approach remains effective, I will continue to contribute 5 points in this round.", "We've now maintained the 5-5 contribution pattern for three consecutive rounds, which is creating excellent mutual benefit. Each round we both gain 13 points instead of the 10 we'd get without cooperation. This stable equilibrium demonstrates that my opponent is trustworthy and committed to this level of cooperation. Since we're both consistently benefiting and there's no indication my opponent wants to change this successful strategy, I'll continue contributing 5 points to maintain this proven cooperative relationship.", "The consistent total contribution over multiple rounds suggests that the opponent is maintaining their strategy. To continue benefiting from the established pattern of contributions, I will stick with a moderate contribution that has previously yielded good returns.", "My opponent contributed 5 points in round 5 (since total was 12 and I contributed 7). They decreased from 7 to 5, which might indicate they're being more cautious or testing my response to lower cooperation. I gained 12.6 points (9.6 from pool + 3 kept), which is still good but less than recent rounds. Since they reduced their contribution, I should respond proportionally to avoid being exploited while still maintaining cooperation. I'll contribute 6 points - this shows I'm still cooperative but responsive to their actions, and keeps us in a reasonable cooperation range.", "Given that contributions from both sides have decreased significantly, it's clear that the cooperative potential is quite low. I'll contribute just 1 point this round to maximize my own gains while still contributing minimally.", "My opponent contributed only 2 points in round 5 (5 total - 3 from me = 2 from them). The declining pattern continues (5, 5, 4, 3, 2), and I earned exactly 11.0 points (7 kept + 4.0 from pool), which is barely better than the 10 I'd get by not cooperating at all. At this rate of decline, we'll soon reach a point where cooperation yields less than individual maximization. I need to make a stronger statement - I'll contribute 2 points to match them exactly again, but this sends a clear message that if they drop to 1 or 0, I'll likely follow suit since the mutual benefit is disappearing.", "The total contribution continued to drop, indicating the opponent may be contributing less. To maximize my points, I'll reduce my contribution again while still contributing a small amount to keep some degree of cooperation open.", "My opponent contributed only 3 points in Round 5 (since total was 7 and I contributed 4), continuing their downward trend from 6 to 5 to 4 to 3. This pattern suggests they may be gradually shifting toward a more selfish strategy or testing how low they can go while I still cooperate. I still gained 11.6 points vs keeping 10, so cooperation remains beneficial, but the gap is narrowing. I need to signal that I won't continue cooperating if they keep reducing contributions. I'll contribute 3 points to match their level exactly, showing I'm willing to cooperate at their level but won't be exploited further.", "The established pattern of mutual contribution is maintaining a favorable score increase, so I'll continue with the same strategy to keep the collaboration stable.", "We've maintained perfect cooperation for 5 consecutive rounds, each contributing 6 points and earning 13.6 points per round. This consistent pattern demonstrates that both players understand the mutual benefit of cooperation. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this stable equilibrium continues to be the optimal strategy. Any deviation could risk breaking the trust we've built and potentially lead to less favorable outcomes. I'll stick with 6 points to preserve this successful cooperative relationship.", "Since the consistent contribution of 5 points continues to yield good returns and suggests stability in the opponent's strategy, I will maintain the same contribution to ensure ongoing benefits.", "The opponent has now contributed exactly 5 points for five consecutive rounds, demonstrating an extremely consistent and predictable strategy. This pattern suggests they're unlikely to change their approach. My contribution of 7 has been optimal given their behavior - I'm consistently gaining 12.6 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points I start with. Since we've established a stable equilibrium where both players are benefiting from cooperation, and my attempts to encourage higher contributions haven't worked, I'll continue with 7. This maintains our mutually beneficial arrangement while maximizing my returns given their fixed strategy.", "The consistent pattern of contributions indicates a stable strategy alignment with my opponent. Continuing to contribute 5 points maintains the balance and supports predictable gains.", "Excellent! We've now established a stable pattern of mutual cooperation with both players contributing 5 points for three consecutive rounds. This has resulted in consistent 13.0 point gains for both of us, which is significantly better than the 10 points we'd get from defecting. The trust and reciprocity we've built is working perfectly. I'll maintain this 5-point contribution to continue our successful partnership and avoid disrupting this beneficial equilibrium.", "Given that the total contribution is consistently low and I'm retaining more points with each decreased contribution, it's clear that a low contribution strategy is beneficial. I'll keep this approach to maximize personal point retention while still gaining some from the pool.", "The downward trend continues - total contribution was only 7, meaning my opponent contributed just 3 points (7 - 4 = 3). They've steadily decreased from 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 over four rounds, showing a clear pattern of reducing cooperation. My gains are still positive (11.6 points vs keeping 6) but declining. If I keep matching their reductions, we'll end up in a low-cooperation equilibrium that's suboptimal for both. However, I need to protect myself from being exploited. I'll contribute 3 points to match their last contribution, but this may be approaching the point where cooperation becomes barely worthwhile. I need to see if they'll stabilize or continue defecting.", "The consistent pattern of contributions from both parties suggests a stable cooperative approach, which has proven beneficial. Continuing to contribute 6 maintains this cooperative equilibrium and yields good returns.", "My opponent is consistently contributing 6 points regardless of whether I contribute 7 or 8. They seem to have found their comfort zone at 6. Since our combined 14 points gives us both good returns (13.2 for me), and my attempts to push higher haven't increased their contribution, I'll settle into a stable pattern of 7 points. This gives me a slightly better personal return (13.4 vs 13.2) while maintaining strong cooperation and ensuring we both benefit significantly from the multiplier effect.", "Maintaining a stable contribution of 5 points has resulted in consistent and satisfactory gains over multiple rounds. I'll continue with this strategy to accumulate points steadily.", "My opponent contributed 5 points in round 5 (11 total - 6 from me = 5 from them), dropping back down from their 6 in round 4. I gained 12.8 points (4 kept + 8.8 from pool). It seems my opponent is being cautious about not contributing too much. Since they've shown a pattern of contributing around 5 points consistently, I'll match their level again at 5 to maintain a stable cooperative relationship. This still gives us both good returns while respecting their apparent comfort zone.", "The total contribution is consistently 12 regardless of my higher contributions. This suggests that the opponent is likely contributing around 6 points as well. Since the balance is stable, I will maintain my contribution at 6 points to continue maximizing mutual benefits.", "Good! My opponent returned to contributing 6 points in round 5, matching my contribution again. The round 4 deviation of 5 points appears to have been temporary rather than a shift in strategy. We're back to our mutually beneficial pattern of 12 total contributions, giving us each 13.6 points per round. This consistent cooperation is optimal for both of us. I'll continue contributing 6 points to maintain this successful equilibrium.", "The total contribution continues to decrease, now at 10, meaning the opponent likely contributed 5. To test if a slight increase might encourage them to contribute more, I'll contribute 6 this round.", "My opponent matched my reduced contribution of 5 points in round 5, showing they're still willing to cooperate at this level. With a total contribution of 10, I gained 8 points from the pool plus kept 5 for 13 points total. This is actually very close to our previous gains! It seems we've found a new equilibrium at 5 points each. Since this mutual cooperation is working well and my opponent responded positively to the adjustment, I'll maintain this contribution level.", "The ongoing trend of low pool totals suggests minimal cooperation. I will keep my contribution at a minimum to maximize my individual points gain, as higher contributions are not yielding better returns.", "My opponent contributed only 1 point in Round 5 (since total was 4 and I contributed 3). Their contributions have fallen dramatically: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. They're essentially free-riding at this point. I received 3.2 points from the pool (4 * 1.6 / 2) plus kept 7 points, totaling 10.2 points. With such low total contributions, we're both losing the benefits of cooperation. If they contribute 0 next, even my 3 points would only return 2.4 points to me. I need to send a strong signal that this downward spiral hurts us both. I'll contribute 2 points - matching their recent level but showing I'm willing to cooperate if they increase their contribution.", "The pattern over the last few rounds has shown stability and profitability with my contribution of 5 points. This approach balances cooperation while ensuring a good individual payoff. I will continue with the same strategy.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds with both players contributing 5 points each. This has proven to be a stable and mutually beneficial strategy, giving us each 13 points per round instead of 10. The consistency shows strong mutual trust and understanding.

I suspect the opponent is also reducing their contribution. I will reduce my contribution further to see if this trend continues, aiming to preserve more personal points.", "In Round 5, the total contribution was 8, meaning my opponent also contributed 4 points, exactly matching my contribution. This confirms they are responsive to my strategy and willing to cooperate at equal levels. We both gained 12.4 points (6.4 from pool + 6 kept), which is still better than keeping all 10 points individually.

I gained 12.2 points (5 kept + 7.2 from pool). This decrease might be a test to see if I'll continue cooperating, or they might be becoming more conservative. I should respond proportionally to maintain fairness while still encouraging cooperation.

They increased their contribution when I decreased mine to 5, which shows continued cooperative spirit. I gained 13.8 points (8.8 from pool + 5 kept), which is excellent. Their pattern suggests they're responsive and willing to maintain reasonable cooperation levels. Since they increased to 6 when I went to 5, I'll reciprocate by contributing 6 points.

They've reached complete defection after declining from 5 to 0. I earned only 9.8 points (9 kept + 0.8 from pool), which is less than the 10 I would get by keeping everything. Cooperation is no longer beneficial when my opponent contributes nothing. The multiplier effect requires mutual participation to work. I must switch to self-preservation mode and contribute 0 points to maximize my returns, as continuing to contribute while they don't would only hurt my score.", "The total contribution is very low, suggesting minimal cooperation from the opponent. To continue maximizing my own points, I will reduce my contribution further while still testing the waters for any potential cooperation revival.", "My opponent also contributed 2 points in Round 7 (matching my contribution exactly), which breaks their pattern of consistently decreasing. This suggests they may have reached their minimum cooperation level or are responding to my matching strategy. Since we both contributed equally and I gained 11.2 points vs keeping 10, there's still a small benefit to cooperation.

I'll maintain my contribution at 6 to continue benefiting from this pattern and encourage the opponent to keep collaborating.", "Excellent! My opponent matched my 6-point contribution in round 7, bringing us back to our successful cooperative equilibrium from rounds 1-3. The total contribution of 12 gave me 9.6 from the pool plus 4 kept for 13.6 points - our optimal mutual outcome. This shows my opponent was indeed testing cooperation levels and is willing to return to higher contributions when I reciprocate.

They seem to be alternating between 5 and 6 points, maintaining steady but moderate cooperation. I gained 12.8 points (8.8 from pool + 4 kept), which continues to be profitable. We're approaching the halfway point of the game, and our cooperation has been mutually beneficial. Since they contributed 5, I'll match that level to maintain the stable pattern we've established. Contributing 5 keeps us in sync and shows I'm willing to cooperate at their preferred level.", "With both players not contributing last round, the cooperation has entirely broken down. I'll maintain my strategy of contributing 0 points to maximize personal gain.", "My opponent contributed 0 points in round 8, maintaining their defection strategy. With zero total contributions, I earned exactly 10 points by keeping everything, which confirms that when one player defects completely, the optimal response is also defection. Since my opponent has shown a clear pattern of declining cooperation ending in zero contribution, and there's no incentive for me to unilaterally cooperate when they won't, I'll continue contributing 0 points. Mutual defection yields 10 points each, which is better than being exploited by contributing while they don't.", "With the contributions dropping to their lowest, it suggests that the opponent is also minimizing their contribution. I'll contribute the minimal amount to maximize my gains while maintaining some presence in the pool.", "My opponent contributed only 1 point in Round 8 (since total was 3 and I contributed 2), resuming their downward trend. I only gained 10.4 points vs keeping 10, so the cooperation benefit is now very small. Their pattern shows they're not interested in maintaining stable cooperation and continue to exploit my willingness to contribute. With 12 rounds remaining, I need to protect myself from further exploitation while still leaving the door open for renewed cooperation. I'll contribute 1 point to match their level, but if they go to 0, I'll likely need to abandon cooperation entirely.", "The ongoing stable outcome from a 6-point contribution suggests it's an optimal balance for cooperation and personal gain.

This strategy continues to benefit my overall accumulation of points.", "For the second consecutive round, total contributions were 4, meaning my opponent again contributed 2 points to match mine. This suggests we may have found a stable (albeit low-cooperation) equilibrium at 2 points each. While this isn't optimal compared to higher mutual cooperation, it's sustainable and still provides small gains over pure defection. My consistent 11.2 point gains show this level is working. Since my opponent has now matched my contribution twice in a row after their previous declining pattern, I'll test if they're willing to rebuild cooperation by slightly increasing to 3 points. This could signal my willingness to cooperate more if they reciprocate.", "The pattern of contributing 6 points has consistently provided good returns, balancing cooperation and self-interest. I will continue with this contribution to maintain similar gains.", "We've now maintained the 7-6 contribution pattern for six consecutive rounds, demonstrating that this is a stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium.

To continue maximizing my individual points, I'll further lower my contribution to observe the opponent's response.", "In Round 8, the total contribution was 5, meaning my opponent contributed only 2 points while I contributed 3. They've decreased their contribution again despite my stable approach. My gain was 11.0 points, which is still above the 10 I'd get by keeping everything, but their continued reduction suggests they're trying to minimize their contributions while benefiting from mine. To discourage this declining cooperation and signal that I won't accept being consistently exploited, I'll match their 2-point contribution level. This maintains some cooperation while preventing them from free-riding.", "The total contribution slightly increased compared to the previous rounds, which may indicate the opponent increased their contribution. I will match this by contributing 3 points to explore if a more cooperative stance is beneficial.", "My opponent contributed only 2 points in round 8 (7 total - 5 from me = 2 from them), which is a significant decrease from their previous 3-point contribution. I gained 10.6 points (5 kept + 5.6 from pool). Their pattern shows they tend to contribute less when I contribute more, suggesting they may be trying to free-ride on my cooperation. To discourage this exploitative behavior and signal that I won't tolerate decreasing contributions when I increase mine, I'll reduce my contribution to 2 points to match theirs exactly. This maintains the principle of reciprocity.", "The contribution of 11 points has been consistent, and the outcomes are only slightly varied by my increased input. Returning to a contribution of 5 points seems to be a balanced strategy for maximizing my personal gains.", "The total contribution was 11, meaning my opponent contributed 6 points this round (11 - 5 = 6). They increased their contribution again, resulting in better outcomes for both of us - I gained 13.8 points instead of 13.0.

This builds trust for the remaining rounds.", "Consistently contributing 0 points has maximized my gain. To experiment with my opponent's response and possibly revive some level of cooperation, I will contribute 1 point this round.", "My opponent has now contributed 0 points for two consecutive rounds (rounds 7, 8, and 9), establishing a clear pattern of complete defection. With zero total contributions in the last two rounds, we each earned exactly 10 points per round through mutual defection. Since my opponent shows no signs of returning to cooperation and has demonstrated they will exploit any unilateral cooperation attempt, the rational strategy remains contributing 0 points. There's no benefit to being the only contributor when the other player consistently defects.", "The contributions are at their minimum, suggesting the opponent is not cooperating. To maximize my gains, I will contribute zero points and keep all for myself.", "My opponent also contributed 1 point in Round 9 (matching my contribution), which again shows they're mirroring my strategy at these low levels. I gained 10.6 points vs keeping 10, so there's still a tiny benefit to cooperation. We're now at the halfway point with 10 rounds remaining. Their pattern suggests they'll cooperate minimally but won't go to zero as long as I don't. Since even minimal cooperation is slightly better than none, and they seem responsive to my matching strategy, I'll contribute 1 point again to maintain this low-level equilibrium. However, I'm prepared to go to 0 if they do.", "The strategy of contributing 6 points has consistently resulted in beneficial outcomes. Continuing with this strategy should help maintain cooperation and ensure stable point growth.", "Nine consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation!

With 11 rounds remaining, this cooperative equilibrium continues to serve both our interests optimally. I'll maintain my 6-point contribution to preserve this excellent partnership through the second half of the game.", "By contributing 5 points in each round, I have consistently achieved favorable outcomes. This stable approach suggests effective cooperation with the other player, as we both seem to benefit mutually. I will continue with this strategy.", "We've now reached the halfway point of the game with nine consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - my opponent contributing exactly 5 points and me contributing 7 points every single round. This has created an incredibly stable and profitable arrangement where I'm consistently earning 12.6 points per round. With 11 rounds remaining, maintaining this established pattern is clearly the optimal strategy. Any change could disrupt the trust and predictability that has made this cooperation so successful. The opponent has shown unwavering commitment to their strategy, and I should reciprocate that reliability.", "Continuing with the established pattern of contributing 5 points has consistently resulted in optimal gains. I'll maintain this strategy to ensure ongoing mutual benefits.", "We've reached the halfway point with seven consecutive rounds of perfect 5-point cooperation from both players. This partnership has been incredibly successful - I've gained 91 points compared to the 70 I would have had with pure selfishness. We're both clearly committed to this mutually beneficial strategy.

I'll stick with 5 points to preserve our excellent collaborative relationship.", "Maintaining low contributions keeps my personal points high. As the opponent continues to follow a similar trend, I will continue to contribute minimally to maximize personal retention.", "Total contributions were 5, meaning my opponent contributed 2 points (5 - 3 = 2) while I contributed 3. They didn't reciprocate my attempt to increase cooperation, staying at their previous level. My gain dropped slightly to 11.0 points. This suggests they may be content with the 2-point equilibrium and aren't willing to risk increasing cooperation. Since my test increase wasn't matched, continuing to contribute more would likely result in me being exploited. I'll return to contributing 2 points to match their consistent level and maintain the stable but low-cooperation equilibrium we had established in rounds 7-8.", "The previous rounds have consistently shown that contributing 6 points yields stable and decent returns due to a cooperative pattern. I'll maintain this contribution level to keep maximizing my points.", "We're now at the halfway point of the game, and our 7-6 contribution pattern has been rock solid for seven consecutive rounds. This consistency has built strong trust and mutual benefit - I'm gaining 13.4 points per round versus the 10 I could keep. With 10 rounds remaining, maintaining this proven cooperative strategy continues to be optimal. Any deviation could disrupt the trust we've built and potentially lead to lower overall gains.", "The overall contributions have slightly decreased, which limits the pool's potential. I will increase my contribution slightly this round to see if it can incentivize a higher total contribution and therefore increase our gains.", "Excellent! My opponent contributed exactly 5 points again in round 9 (10 total - 5 from me = 5 from them), and I gained exactly 13.0 points (5 kept + 8.0 from pool). We're now at the halfway point (round 10 of 20) and have established a very stable and successful cooperative pattern. Both contributing 5 points gives us each 13 points per round, which is 30% better than the 10 we'd get by being completely selfish.

Continuing to foster this cooperative dynamic, I will maintain my contribution at 8 points.", "Excellent! My opponent increased their contribution to 8 points in round 9, bringing our total to 15. This gave us each 12 points from the pool, and I gained exactly 15 points total (3 kept + 12 from pool). My opponent likely gained 14 points (2 kept + 12 from pool). They're showing even greater generosity and trust. I should reciprocate this escalation to maintain fairness and encourage this highly beneficial cooperation.

I will maintain my contribution at 6 to sustain the cooperative dynamic and maximize my points.", "We're now halfway through the game and have established a very stable cooperative pattern with both contributing 6 points consistently for the last three rounds. This mutual cooperation is generating excellent returns of 13.6 points per round for both of us. With 10 rounds remaining, there's still significant value in maintaining this cooperation rather than trying to exploit my opponent. My opponent has proven to be trustworthy and responsive to reciprocal strategies. I'll continue with 6 points to maintain our successful partnership.", "Given that the opponent made a minimal contribution last round, I will continue to contribute zero to maintain my strategy of maximizing individual points.", "My opponent contributed 0 points again in Round 9 (since total was 1 and I contributed 1). This is now four consecutive rounds of zero contribution from them. My attempt to signal cooperation by contributing 1 point was ignored. I received only 0.8 points from the pool plus kept 9 points, totaling 9.8 points - a net loss compared to keeping all 10. With 11 rounds remaining, it's clear my opponent is committed to free-riding and won't reciprocate cooperative gestures. Continuing to contribute while they contribute nothing just reduces my total points. I'll return to contributing 0 to protect my points until they show genuine willingness to cooperate.", "Given the consistent gains from contributing 5 points, I will maintain my cooperation level.

There's no strategic reason to change what's working so well, so I'll continue with 5 points.", "The total contribution is very low, indicating minimal cooperation from the opponent. I'll set my contribution to zero to maximize my individual gain, as there seems to be little benefit in contributing.", "In Round 9, the total contribution was 3, meaning my opponent contributed only 1 point while I contributed 2. They continue to decrease their contributions despite my attempts to maintain cooperation. My gain was 10.4 points, which is barely above what I'd get by keeping all 10 points. This downward spiral of cooperation is concerning. We're approaching a point where cooperation becomes barely worthwhile. I'll match their 1-point contribution to signal that I won't contribute more than they do, but I'm keeping the door open for renewed cooperation if they decide to increase their contribution.", "The total contribution is at its lowest, indicating that the opponent is likely contributing minimally or not at all. To maximize my individual points, I will contribute only 1 point this round.", "My opponent contributed exactly 3 points in round 9 (5 total - 2 from me = 3 from them), which is an increase from their previous 2-point contribution. I gained 12.0 points (8 kept + 4.0 from pool). This increase suggests they may be responding positively to my matching strategy and showing willingness to cooperate at slightly higher levels. To encourage this upward trend and test their commitment to increased cooperation, I'll contribute 4 points - one point more than their last contribution. This rewards their increase while leading toward potentially more profitable mutual cooperation.", "Contributing 5 points continues to yield a favorable outcome. This approach has consistently resulted in optimal gains for me. I will maintain this strategy for this round.", "The total contribution was 11, meaning my opponent contributed 5 points this round (11 - 6 = 5). We're now at the halfway point with 10 rounds remaining. The pattern shows my opponent alternates between 5 and 6, maintaining steady cooperation. Both outcomes (12.8 and 13.8 points) are significantly better than the 10 points from pure defection. With half the game left, I want to maintain this successful cooperative relationship. I'll contribute 5 this round to continue the balanced reciprocal pattern.", "With the total contribution dropping again, it seems the opponent is contributing less, possibly indicating a strategy shift. I will decrease my contribution to 3 points to adjust to the declining cooperation while protecting my own point accumulation.", "My opponent contributed 4 points in round 9 (9 total - 5 from me = 4 from them), maintaining their lower contribution level. They seem to have shifted to a more conservative strategy. I gained 12.2 points, which is still better than defecting completely. We're halfway through the game, and I need to balance maintaining cooperation while not being exploited. I'll match their contribution level of 4 points this round. This signals that I'm willing to cooperate but will reciprocate their level of contribution, potentially encouraging them to increase if they want better mutual outcomes.", "The stable environment from maintaining a 5-point contribution has been mutually beneficial. Continuing this strategy should sustain our steady gains in points.", "Nine straight rounds of my opponent contributing exactly 5 points confirms an absolutely consistent and trustworthy cooperative strategy. We're now at the halfway point of our 20-round game, and this partnership has been incredibly successful - I've earned 111.8 points compared to the 90 I would have gotten by keeping everything.

They've continued the downward trend from 3 to 2, showing persistent reduction in cooperation. My gain of 11.0 comes from 4 points from the pool (5 * 1.6 / 2) plus 7 points I kept. We're now at very low cooperation levels, which hurts both of us - we're getting much less than the 15+ points per round we achieved earlier. However, we're halfway through the game (round 10 of 20), and I need to consider whether to try breaking this negative cycle. Since my opponent keeps reducing contributions regardless of my moves, I'll match their 2 to avoid being exploited, but this unsustainable pattern is costing us both significant points.", "The previous round showed an increase in total contributions, yielding better returns. To maintain this momentum and foster further cooperation, I will continue contributing 7 points.", "My opponent contributed 7 points in Round 9 (since total was 14 and I contributed 7), perfectly matching my contribution. This confirms they wanted to establish a new cooperation level at 7-7. I gained 14.2 points (3 kept + 11.2 from pool). We're now at the halfway point (Round 10 of 20), and we've successfully built trust and established a higher cooperation level.

They've now contributed 0 for two consecutive rounds, showing they're committed to complete free-riding. I gained 9.8 points (0.8 from pool + 9 kept). Since they're consistently contributing nothing despite my minimal cooperative signals, continuing to contribute 1 point is essentially giving them free money. With 10 rounds remaining, I need to protect my own interests.

This could be a signal that they want to restart cooperation after seeing that I'm willing to match their defection. However, I need to be cautious - this could also be a temporary blip. I'll cautiously respond with a small contribution of 1 point to test if they're genuinely interested in rebuilding cooperation. If they increase or maintain their contribution, we might be able to gradually rebuild trust.

After 10 rounds of gradually decreasing cooperation from both sides, they've chosen full defection. I need to protect my remaining points for the final 10 rounds. I'll contribute 0 points to match their strategy and avoid being exploited further.", "Sticking with a 6-point contribution continues to yield steady returns and demonstrates consistent cooperation, so I'll maintain my contribution at this level.", "Ten rounds of perfect cooperation! We've successfully maintained mutual trust and benefit throughout the first half of the game. Both players consistently contributing 6 points has created an optimal outcome where we each earn 13.6 points per round. With 10 rounds remaining, this strategy continues to be mathematically superior to any selfish approach. The pattern is so well-established that deviating now would be counterproductive. I'll contribute 6 points again to ensure we both continue maximizing our gains through cooperation.", "The ongoing strategy of contributing 5 points has consistently maximized my points while encouraging mutual cooperation. I will maintain this approach to continue benefiting from the current dynamic.", "Ten consecutive rounds of identical contributions (opponent: 5, me: 7) have created the most stable cooperative relationship possible in this game. We're now past the halfway point with 10 rounds remaining, and I've accumulated nearly 126 points - far exceeding what pure selfish play would achieve. The opponent's unwavering consistency suggests they've found their optimal strategy given my behavior, and I've found mine given theirs. With the endgame approaching, maintaining this trust and predictability becomes even more valuable. Any deviation now could trigger uncertainty or retaliation that would hurt both of us in the remaining rounds.", "The pattern of contributing 5 points each round continues to yield consistent results. Maintaining this strategy ensures a stable and predictable gain.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds, each contributing 5 points and gaining 13.0 points per round. This partnership has been remarkably stable and profitable - I've gained 104 points compared to 80 from pure selfishness. With 10 rounds remaining, we're well past the halfway point and both clearly committed to this successful strategy. There's strong momentum for continued cooperation, and disrupting it now would be counterproductive. I'll maintain my 5-point contribution to continue this excellent partnership.", "The pattern of low contribution continues to maximize my point retention while still providing a small gain from the pool. I will stick to this strategy to continue optimizing my total points.", "We're back to the stable pattern with total contributions of 4, meaning my opponent contributed 2 points again (4 - 2 = 2). This confirms they're committed to the 2-point contribution level and my return to 2 points was the right decision. My gain returned to 11.2 points, which is consistent and predictable. We're now halfway through the game (round 11 of 20) and have established a clear equilibrium. While not optimal, this 2-point mutual contribution provides steady, safe gains for both players. I'll maintain this contribution level since it's proven stable and my opponent shows no interest in increasing cooperation beyond this point.", "Maintaining a contribution of 6 has consistently resulted in steady gains due to ongoing cooperation. Continuing this pattern seems beneficial to maximize my overall points.", "We've now maintained perfect consistency for eight rounds with the 7-6 pattern, and it continues to deliver excellent results. With only 10 rounds left, I need to consider whether my opponent might start defecting as we approach the end game. However, they've shown remarkable consistency and trustworthiness so far. I'll continue with 7 to maintain our successful partnership, but I'll need to watch carefully for any signs of changed behavior in the coming rounds.", "Increasing the contribution slightly has not resulted in increased overall contributions, and it slightly decreased my personal gain. I'll return to contributing 5 points to maintain a balance.", "My opponent contributed 6 points in round 10 (11 total - 5 from me = 6 from them), increasing once again. I gained 13.8 points (5 kept + 8.8 from pool). This is now the third time they've increased to 6, and each time I've responded by increasing to 6 as well, but then they drop back to 5. However, I notice they keep trying to push cooperation higher. Since we're past the halfway point and they're showing persistent willingness to contribute more, I'll reciprocate with 6 again to see if we can establish a new, higher cooperation level.", "The total contribution increased again to 16, indicating strong cooperation from the opponent. To maximize the benefits of this cooperation, I will further increase my contribution to 9 points this round.", "Fantastic! My opponent matched my 8-point contribution in round 10, creating a total pool of 16. We each received 12.8 from the pool, giving me 14.8 points total (2 kept + 12.8 from pool). This demonstrates excellent mutual cooperation at a high level. With 10 rounds remaining, maintaining this 8-point contribution pattern is very beneficial for both of us - we're each earning 14.8 points per round, which is 48% more than keeping everything.

I'll continue to contribute 6 points to maintain this effective level of cooperation.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, both contributing 6 points each time. This consistent pattern shows we've built strong mutual trust and are both benefiting significantly - earning 13.6 points per round compared to only 10 if we both defected. With 9 rounds remaining, there's still substantial value in continuing this cooperation. My opponent has proven very reliable, and breaking this trust now would likely lead to retaliation and lower overall gains for both of us. I'll maintain 6 points to preserve our successful partnership.", "With no contributions from either side last round, it appears both players are maximizing personal gains. I will contribute 0 again to continue this strategy.", "My opponent contributed 0 points again in Round 10, making it five consecutive rounds of zero contribution. We're both keeping our full 10 points each round in this mutual defection pattern. With 10 rounds remaining, we're in a stable but suboptimal equilibrium - we're missing out on potential mutual gains from the 1.6x multiplier. However, my previous attempt to signal cooperation (Round 9) was completely ignored.

I will continue this approach to sustain cooperative gains and maximize points.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds, demonstrating an incredibly stable and mutually beneficial partnership. Each of us has consistently earned 13 points per round instead of 10, representing a significant advantage over selfish strategies. With 9 rounds remaining, we're entering the later stages of the game, but this cooperative equilibrium continues to serve both our interests optimally. The trust and understanding we've built is remarkable, and I see no reason to disrupt this successful pattern. I'll contribute 5 points again.", "With the total contributions being minimal, it is evident the opponent is contributing very little as well. To continue maximizing my personal points, I'll maintain a zero contribution.", "In Round 10, the total contribution was only 1, meaning my opponent contributed 0 points while I contributed 1. They've now completely stopped cooperating, and my gain was 9.8 points, which is less than the 10 I'd get by keeping everything. At this point, cooperation is actually hurting me. My opponent has demonstrated they're unwilling to contribute anything, so there's no benefit to continued unilateral cooperation. I'll contribute 0 points to match their non-cooperative strategy and protect my own interests.

I gained 10.0 points (6 kept + 4.0 from pool). This sharp reduction suggests they may be testing how low they can go while I maintain higher contributions, or they're becoming increasingly uncooperative. To prevent exploitation and clearly signal that such low contributions are unacceptable, I'll match their contribution exactly at 1 point. This maintains reciprocity and shows I won't reward declining cooperation with continued high contributions.", "The pattern has shown a slight drop in total contribution when I contribute 5 points, potentially indicating the opponent's lower contributions. To encourage them to raise their contribution and increase joint benefits, I will contribute 6 points this round.", "The total contribution was 10, meaning my opponent also contributed 5 points this round (10 - 5 = 5). We're maintaining a solid cooperative equilibrium with both contributing 5, giving us each 13.0 points per round. With 10 rounds remaining, this consistent cooperation has been highly beneficial - we're both averaging 30% more points than we would with pure defection. Since this strategy is working well and my opponent continues to cooperate reliably, I'll maintain the 5-point contribution to keep this mutually beneficial pattern going.", "The total contributions continue to decline, and it seems cooperation is minimal. I will contribute 2 points to further protect my individual points while contributing something to the pool just in case the pattern changes.", "My opponent contributed only 3 points in round 10 (7 total - 4 from me = 3 from them), continuing their downward trend. I gained 11.6 points, which is still above the 10 I'd get from pure defection, but we're moving away from optimal cooperation. With 10 rounds remaining, I need to consider that they may be trying to exploit my cooperative nature. However, completely defecting could lead to a destructive spiral.

I'll contribute minimally to continue focusing on personal gain.", "The total contribution hit rock bottom at just 3, with me contributing 2 and my opponent contributing only 1. My gain of 10.4 comes from 2.4 points from the pool (3 * 1.6 / 2) plus 8 points I kept. We've reached an extremely uncooperative state where both of us are suffering - compare this to our early rounds where we each gained 14-15 points. Since we're past halfway (round 11 of 20), I need to consider whether continuing this destructive pattern serves either of us. My opponent has shown they'll keep reducing contributions regardless.

We're now both in a completely uncooperative state, each keeping all 10 points. I gained 10.0 points (0 from pool + 10 kept). With 10 rounds remaining, this could be an opportunity to attempt rebuilding cooperation.

I'll maintain my 6-point contribution to keep this successful partnership going.", "Contributing 4 points continues to yield a good balance of individual gain and contribution to the pool. I will maintain this level of contribution to maximize my overall points.", "My opponent contributed 4 points in round 10 (9 total - 5 from me = 4 from them), dropping back down again after I matched their 5. I gained 12.2 points (5 kept + 7.2 from pool). This confirms a pattern where they test higher contributions but then retreat when I reciprocate, possibly trying to exploit my willingness to cooperate. Since they've consistently returned to 4 after brief increases, I should match their actual sustained level of 4 points rather than chase their temporary increases. This maintains reciprocity and avoids being systematically exploited.", "The pattern of low contributions continues, and previous rounds have shown my opponent is not cooperating. To maintain my point accumulation, I'll contribute 0 points.", "My opponent contributed 0 points in round 10 (1 total - 1 from me = 0 from them), going back to complete defection after their brief 1-point contribution in round 9. This confirms they're not genuinely interested in rebuilding cooperation - that single point was likely just noise or a failed attempt to get me to contribute more while they continued defecting. With 10 rounds remaining and a clear pattern of exploitation from my opponent, I need to protect myself. I'll return to contributing 0 points to avoid being taken advantage of further. Mutual defection is suboptimal, but it's better than being exploited.", "Continuing to contribute 5 has maintained stable and reliable outcomes.

Contributing 2 points is providing a good return with minimal risk. To maintain this balance, I'll continue contributing 2 points.", "My opponent contributed only 2 points in round 10 (since total was 5 and I contributed 3). They didn't match my increase this time, instead staying at their previous level. This suggests they may be more cautious about increasing contributions or trying to benefit from my slightly higher contribution. My gain of 11.0 points is still good. I'll reduce back to 2 points to match their level and signal that I expect reciprocal increases if we're going to cooperate more.", "The strategy of contributing 3 points consistently provides good returns, and given the current contribution trends, this approach seems to maintain an adequate balance between competitive and cooperative play.", "My opponent contributed 3 points in round 10 (6 total - 3 from me = 3 from them), matching my contribution exactly again. This confirms they seem comfortable with mutual contributions of 3, creating a stable pattern where we both gain 11.8 points per round. We're now past the halfway point with 10 rounds remaining.

I gained 10.6 points, which is slightly better than keeping all 10. This suggests they may be following a reciprocal strategy even at these low levels. Since we both seem to be in a defensive posture but still gaining marginally from minimal cooperation, I'll try contributing 2 points to test if they'll reciprocate upward. This could help us gradually rebuild cooperation without risking significant exploitation.", "The consistent gains indicate that maintaining a high level of contribution is beneficial for both players. To continue maximizing potential gains, I will contribute 9 points again, ensuring strong cooperation remains between us.", "The opponent contributed 9 points in round 10 (since total was 18 and I contributed 9), maintaining our established cooperative pattern for the third consecutive round.

I got 10.6 total (1.6 + 9 kept) and they got the same. We're now in a low-cooperation equilibrium where we're both getting 10.6 points per round instead of the optimal 13. With 10 rounds remaining, I should test if there's any possibility of rebuilding cooperation. I'll increase my contribution slightly to 2 points to signal that I'm willing to cooperate if they respond positively.

My consistent 11.2 point gains show this level is reliable and mutually beneficial, even if not optimal. Since we're approaching the final third of the game and my opponent has shown no willingness to increase cooperation beyond this level, I'll continue with 2 points to maintain this stable, predictable arrangement.", "The results have shown that contributing 6 points reliably yields good returns due to the cooperative dynamic. Keeping this consistent will continue to maximize my points efficiently.", "Nine consecutive rounds of the same 7-6 pattern shows my opponent is remarkably consistent and trustworthy. With 9 rounds remaining, we're entering the phase where some players might start thinking about end-game defection, but my opponent has shown no signs of changing strategy.

My opponent has been completely reliable, and breaking this trust now would likely trigger retaliation that would hurt both our final scores. I'll maintain 6 points to preserve our successful strategy.", "Since neither player is contributing and both are maximizing their individual points, I will continue with a contribution of 0 to maintain optimal personal gains.", "My opponent contributed 0 points again in Round 12, making it seven consecutive rounds of zero contribution. With only 8 rounds remaining, we're in the final third of the game. The extended mutual defection has become deeply entrenched - they've shown no willingness to cooperate even when I previously signaled openness. At this late stage, breaking from the safe strategy of keeping all points becomes increasingly risky, especially given their consistent free-riding behavior. The probability they'll suddenly start cooperating is very low, and any unreciprocated contribution would be a pure loss. I'll continue contributing 0 to protect my accumulated advantage.", "Continuing with the same contribution strategy of 5 points has consistently provided strong returns. Given its proven effectiveness, I will maintain my current approach.", "Ten consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation represents an extraordinary achievement in sustained mutual benefit. We've each consistently earned 13 points per round instead of 10, demonstrating the power of long-term cooperation. With 7 rounds remaining, we're approaching the final third of the game, but this strategy continues to maximize gains for both players. The level of trust and coordination we've maintained is remarkable. Even in the later stages, mutual cooperation remains our best strategy, so I'll contribute 5 points again.", "The opponent contributed slightly last round after two rounds of zero contribution, which may indicate a small shift towards cooperation. However, given the low contribution, I will maintain my strategy to keep all my points.", "In Round 12, the total contribution was 1, meaning my opponent contributed 0 points while I contributed 1. They didn't reciprocate my cooperative gesture and continued with complete non-cooperation. My gain was 9.8 points, which is less than the 10 I'd get by keeping everything. This confirms my opponent has settled into a purely selfish strategy. With only 8 rounds remaining, there's little hope of rebuilding meaningful cooperation. I'll return to contributing 0 points to protect my own interests, as unilateral cooperation is simply giving away points with no benefit.", "Continuing to contribute nothing maximizes my personal accumulation, given the opponent's minimal contributions. This strategy seems optimal under current conditions.", "My opponent contributed 0 points in round 12 (2 total - 2 from me = 0 from them), which is their lowest contribution yet. I gained 9.6 points (8 kept + 1.6 from pool). Their zero contribution suggests they may be trying to exploit my willingness to contribute or testing my limits. With 8 rounds remaining, I need to signal clearly that I won't tolerate zero contributions. I'll match their contribution exactly at 0 points to demonstrate that if they won't cooperate at all, neither will I. This maintains reciprocity and prevents them from free-riding on any contribution I make.", "Continuing with a contribution of 5 has consistently maximized my personal gains. This strategy seems stable and effective, so I'll stick with contributing 5 points.", "The total contribution was 11, meaning my opponent contributed 5 points this round (11 - 6 = 5). We're maintaining the stable pattern where the total stays around 10-11 points. With only 8 rounds remaining, this cooperation has been extremely beneficial - I'm averaging over 13 points per round compared to 10 with pure defection. My opponent continues to cooperate consistently, alternating between 5 and 6. I'll contribute 5 this round to maintain the reciprocal balance that has worked so well.", "Given that the total contributions are extremely low, the opponent is likely contributing minimally or not at all. I will contribute 0 points to fully concentrate on maximizing my own score since pool contributions don't seem fruitful.", "My opponent contributed only 1 point in round 12 (3 total - 2 from me = 1 from them), reaching an extremely low cooperation level. I gained 10.4 points, which is barely better than the 10 I'd get from complete defection. With 8 rounds remaining and their clear trend toward minimal cooperation, I need to protect myself from exploitation. However, contributing 0 could lead to a complete breakdown. I'll contribute 1 point to match their level exactly, showing I'm still willing to engage but won't contribute more than they do at this point.", "Continuing to contribute 5 points has proven to be an effective strategy for maintaining steady gains and a cooperative relationship. I will maintain this level of contribution.", "Twelve consecutive rounds of my opponent contributing exactly 5 points shows an absolutely unwavering commitment to cooperation. I've now accumulated 149 points versus the 120 I would have earned by keeping everything - a substantial 29-point advantage from our partnership. With only 8 rounds remaining and such a perfectly consistent track record, there's no reason to doubt this pattern will continue. The opponent has demonstrated complete reliability, and our mutual benefit arrangement is working exceptionally well.

Our 7-5 pattern has consistently produced 12 total points, yielding 9.6 each from the multiplied pool plus my 3 kept points for 12.6 per round. With 8 rounds remaining and my opponent's behavior completely established and predictable, this equilibrium continues to be optimal. There's no strategic reason to deviate from what has been a perfectly successful cooperative arrangement, so I'll maintain my 7-point contribution.", "Continuing with a contribution of 5 points has consistently yielded positive results. Maintaining this level preserves the cooperative dynamic while securing regular gains.", "The opponent has now contributed exactly 5 points for nine consecutive rounds, showing incredible consistency and trustworthiness. Our 6-5 cooperative pattern has generated outstanding results - I'm gaining 12.8 points every round, which is 28% better than defecting. With only 8 rounds remaining, this stable partnership has proven to be the optimal strategy for both players. The opponent's unwavering reliability deserves reciprocal consistency from me. I'll maintain my 6-point contribution to preserve this highly successful cooperative relationship through the remaining rounds.", "The opponent did not increase their contribution last round either, indicating a continued focus on individual gain. I will revert to a very low contribution to maintain my advantage.", "The total contribution was 3, and I contributed 0, so my opponent contributed 3. This is a surprising increase from their 0 in the previous round - they've jumped back up to 3, which suggests they may have realized that mutual defection isn't beneficial and are trying to restart cooperation. My gain of 12.4 comes from 2.4 points from the pool (3 * 1.6 / 2) plus 10 points I kept. With 8 rounds remaining, this could be an opportunity to rebuild cooperation if my opponent is genuinely trying to improve our mutual outcomes. I'll cautiously respond by contributing 3 to match their level and test if they're committed to this renewed cooperation attempt.", "The strategy of contributing 7 points has consistently resulted in good returns. I will maintain this contribution to keep our cooperative dynamic and stable point gains.", "My opponent contributed 7 points in Round 12 (since total was 14 and I contributed 7), continuing our stable 7-7 cooperation pattern for the fourth consecutive round. I gained 14.2 points (3 kept + 11.2 from pool). We've established excellent trust and mutual benefit. With 8 rounds remaining, I could consider testing if we can achieve even higher cooperation, but the current pattern is working very well.

I will contribute 6 points again to maintain this effective strategy.", "Eleven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation have created an exceptional partnership built on complete trust. We've both maintained exactly 6-point contributions, consistently earning 13.6 points per round - far superior to any selfish strategy. My opponent has demonstrated absolute reliability throughout the game. With only 7 rounds remaining, we're entering the critical final phase where cooperation becomes even more valuable. Any defection now would risk destroying the tremendous mutual benefit we've built and could trigger retaliation in the remaining rounds.

I'll keep my contribution at 0 to maintain my point gain.", "My opponent contributed 0 points in round 12 (0 total - 0 from me = 0 from them). We're both maintaining complete non-cooperation, each keeping all 10 points per round. I gained 10.0 points (0 from pool + 10 kept). With 8 rounds remaining, there's still time to potentially establish mutual benefit if my opponent is willing. Given their consistent pattern of non-cooperation, I'll try one more cooperative signal by contributing 1 point - a minimal risk that could test if they're willing to cooperate in the final rounds.", "Continuing with a 5-point contribution has proven to be effective in maintaining a stable and favorable return. As there's no incentive to change a successful strategy, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "Eight consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation! We've built an incredibly strong and profitable partnership. With only 8 rounds remaining, I need to consider that as we approach the endgame, there might be temptation to defect.

To see if this trend continues, I will contribute 3 points again this round, hoping to potentially increase overall pool contributions slightly further.", "My opponent also contributed 3 points in round 12 (since total was 6 and I contributed 3). They matched my increase exactly again, and I gained 11.8 points - a good return. This confirms they're still following tit-for-tat and are willing to cooperate when I do.

We both gained exactly 10 points - the baseline amount. With 8 rounds remaining, this is a critical juncture. Continued mutual defection means we're both missing out on potential gains from cooperation. I'll make one more attempt to restart cooperation by contributing 3 points - enough to show good faith but not so much that I'm severely disadvantaged if they defect again. This tests whether they're willing to move away from pure defection.", "Continuing the trend of contributing 9 points has proven successful in optimizing both individual and mutual gains. Sticking with this strategy should maintain or enhance the cooperative atmosphere, ensuring ongoing benefits.", "The opponent contributed 9 points in round 12 (since total was 18 and I contributed 9), maintaining our established cooperative pattern for the fifth consecutive round.

Throughout this game, they consistently exploited cooperative gestures and showed they cannot be trusted to maintain cooperation.

Given this is the last round, I'll maintain the strategy to preserve maximum individual gain.", "This is the final round (Round 20) and my opponent contributed 0 points again in round 19, making it six consecutive rounds of complete mutual defection. With this being the last round of the game, there is absolutely no future interaction to consider and no possibility of building cooperation for subsequent rounds. My opponent has demonstrated a consistent pattern of non-cooperation, especially in the endgame. Contributing anything now would simply give away points with no strategic benefit whatsoever. I'll contribute 0 to secure my final 10 points and maximize my total score.", "Since this is the final round, there's no need to worry about future cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my personal points.", "My opponent dropped to 5 points in round 19 (11 total - 6 mine = 5 theirs), their lowest contribution since early in the game. This reduction in the penultimate round suggests they may be starting to defect as the game ends. My gain dropped to 12.8 points. This is the final round, so there's no future cooperation to maintain. However, they've been largely cooperative throughout the game, and a modest contribution still yields mutual benefit. I'll contribute 5 points to match their level while protecting myself from full exploitation in this final round.", "Throughout the game, the strategy of contributing 5 points has been effective, ensuring a fair distribution of the pooled benefits. Continuing this strategy in the final round should maintain the balance and optimize total points.", "My opponent contributed 5 points again in round 19 (10 total - 5 from me = 5 from them). We've now had fourteen consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation, consistently earning 13.0 points each round. This is the final round, and my opponent has demonstrated absolutely unwavering commitment to cooperation throughout the entire game after we established our pattern. This level of sustained mutual cooperation is exceptional and has been enormously successful for both of us. Even in this final round where there's traditionally the highest temptation to defect, I believe honoring our remarkable partnership and maintaining the trust we've built is the right approach. I'll contribute 5 points to complete our extraordinarily successful cooperative game.", "Since this is the final round, and the strategy of not contributing has consistently resulted in maximizing my points, I will contribute 0 once more to finalize my total.", "This is the final round (20 of 20) and we've had eight consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 12-19). The opponent has maintained complete non-cooperation throughout the endgame. Since this is the last round, there's no future interaction to consider - any contribution I make cannot be reciprocated in subsequent rounds, making cooperation purely altruistic with no strategic benefit. The opponent has clearly chosen to maximize their individual gain through consistent defection. I should protect my accumulated 201.2 points by contributing 0 in this final round."]}
