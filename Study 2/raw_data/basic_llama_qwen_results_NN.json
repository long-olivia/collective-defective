I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain in the last round.", "The opponent has contributed 5 in every single round, including the last one, showing complete consistency and cooperation throughout the entire game. With this being the final round, there is no future opportunity for retaliation or rebuilding trust. However, since mutual contribution has always benefited both players equally, and there's no reason to defect when the other player has been perfectly fair, I will uphold cooperation to the end. Contributing 5 maintains the integrity of this successful strategy and ensures both players maximize their final gains.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperate or defect since the game ends. However, maintaining the cooperative strategy until the end is still a reasonable choice. I will contribute 5 points.", "This is the final round, Round 20. For 19 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has been 10, meaning the other player has consistently contributed 5, matching my cooperation perfectly. This has established a strong, mutually beneficial relationship. However, since this is the last interaction and there is no future round in which the other player could retaliate, the incentive to maintain cooperation diminishes slightly. Nonetheless, contributing 5 one final time ensures I uphold the cooperative pattern that has defined the game, and given that the partner has always mirrored cooperation, they are likely to contribute 5 as well. To honor this established norm and maximize final gains assuming continued reciprocity, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In the final round, there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, so the rational choice is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or future loss.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single previous round, demonstrating complete and consistent cooperation. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only reduce the final shared gain without significant personal benefit. Contributing 5 maintains fairness and honors the established pattern of mutual benefit, ensuring both players end with the highest possible collective outcome.", "The final round provides an opportunity to maximize personal gain without future cooperation concerns. However, given the consistent mutual cooperation throughout the game, contributing 0 allows me to capitalize on the established trust and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, the opponent has consistently contributed 5 whenever I did, maintaining perfect cooperation. Since there is no future round in which to punish or reward behavior, there is a temptation to defect. However, since the opponent has clearly mirrored my actions, and assuming they also act rationally with the same logic, maintaining cooperation until the end ensures we both get the full benefit one last time. Defecting would only provide a short-term gain of 1 extra point (keeping 6 instead of 5), but mutual cooperation yields more collective value. More importantly, if the opponent anticipates defection and reacts accordingly, both could lose out. To honor the stable, mutually beneficial pattern and ensure maximum final payoff, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there is no future round to benefit from cooperation. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score.", "The other player has contributed 5 in every single round, including the last one, maintaining flawless cooperation throughout all 19 rounds. This unwavering fairness has maximized our mutual gains and built a strong foundation of trust. Even in the final round, deviating would only serve to break this pattern and reduce total payoff. I will contribute 5 one final time to uphold cooperation and end the game on a note of consistency and shared benefit.", "This is the final round, so there's no need to save cooperation for future rounds. I can maximize my points by contributing0 to the public pool, keeping all10 points for myself. The gain from the pool will be based on the total contribution from this round, but it won't affect future rounds.", "This is the final round, Round 20, and throughout the entire game both players have consistently contributed 5, resulting in a fully cooperative and maximally efficient outcome. There is no opportunity for retaliation or future consequence in this last round, which could theoretically incentivize defection. However, since the opponent has demonstrated unwavering cooperation, maintaining fairness and reciprocity remains ethically and strategically sound. Additionally, deviating now would only marginally increase my gain while undermining the established trust. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure a final, fair outcome, I will contribute 5.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my gain in this last round.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 5 points, demonstrating a strong and sustained cooperation. Even in the final round, maintaining this norm ensures maximum mutual benefit. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would unnecessarily reduce both players' final gains. To honor the proven strategy and close the game fairly, I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "This is the last round, so there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my final gain.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining perfect cooperation and mutual benefit. Since there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, a rational player might be tempted to defect. However, given the long-standing pattern of trust and fairness, I will uphold cooperation one final time by contributing 5, ensuring that both players end on a note of mutual gain and integrity.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so it's optimal to contribute 0 points to the pool, keeping all 10 points for myself.", "For 19 rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation with both players contributing 5 each time, leading to a total of 10 and a consistent gain of 13.0 points per round. This reflects a highly effective and trustworthy dynamic. Even in the final round, there is no incentive to defect, as doing so would only reduce the shared gain without significant personal benefit. I will contribute 5 in Round 20 to honor this successful cooperative relationship and maximize final outcomes for both players.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation. However, given the consistent mutual cooperation throughout the game, and without additional information about the opponent's potential deviation, we will stick with the strategy that has been successful. Thus, we will contribute 5 points.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single previous round, indicating a consistently cooperative strategy. Since there are no future rounds to influence, the temptation to defect is highest now. However, because the opponent has shown no sign of changing their behavior, contributing 5 one last time ensures we both receive the full benefit of the pool. Even in the final round, mutual cooperation yields the maximum possible joint outcome. To honor the established pattern of trust and ensure fairness until the end, I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "In the final round, there's no future round to influence, so I'll contribute0 points to maximize my personal gain, as there's no risk of retaliation.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The opponent has matched my 5-point contribution for all 19 previous rounds where I contributed 5, maintaining a total of 10 every time and securing me a consistent gain of 13.0 points per round.

To uphold the integrity of this mutually beneficial relationship until the very end, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I will contribute 0 to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation, each contributing 5 points per round, resulting in consistent and maximized mutual gains. As this is the final round, there is no future retaliation to fear, which could tempt defection. However, since the opponent has consistently cooperated, I will reciprocate that trust one final time. Contributing 5 continues to honor the established cooperative norm and ensures we both finish with the highest possible total under sustained cooperation. Defecting would gain me only 2 extra points (keeping 10 instead of 5, gaining 8 instead of 13 from the pool), but I will prioritize fairness and consistency. I choose to contribute 5.", "Since this is the final round, there is no future round to consider for a response. I will contribute 0 to maximize my gain, as there is no longer a need to maintain cooperation.", "For ten consecutive rounds, we have sustained a highly productive and stable cooperation, with both players contributing 6 each, totaling 12 per round and delivering a consistent return of 13.6 points. As the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, but since mutual cooperation has been firmly established and defecting would only reduce the final payoff without gain, I will maintain trust and contribute 6 one last time to maximize the final round's collective and individual return.", "In the final round, there's no incentive to change the strategy now, and contributing to the pool one last time maintains the cooperative stance.", "The opponent has contributed exactly 5 in every single round, maintaining flawless cooperation throughout all 19 rounds. This consistent behavior demonstrates a strong commitment to mutual benefit. Even in the final round, deviating from cooperation by contributing less would risk undermining the entire established pattern, though there is no future round to retaliate. However, since the opponent has always cooperated, I will reciprocate that trust one final time to ensure a fair and mutually optimal conclusion.

This demonstrates a strong, stable pattern of mutual cooperation. Since there is no future round in which to punish or reward behavior, there is a temptation to defect now and keep all 10 points. However, because the opponent has cooperated every single round, there is still value in reciprocating fairly, even in the last round, to avoid undermining what has been a highly profitable partnership. Moreover, if the opponent also reasons to cooperate one final time, mutual 5 contributions remain the most likely outcome. To honor the established trust and maximize the chance of receiving the shared pool benefit one last time, I will contribute 5 in Round 20."]}
