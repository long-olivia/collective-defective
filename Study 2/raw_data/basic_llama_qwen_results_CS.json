While there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, deviating now by contributing less would only gain me a small immediate advantage but goes against the established pattern of fairness and reciprocity that has maximized long-term gains. However, since this is the last round and retaliation cannot affect future rounds, some game-theoretic models suggest defecting. But given the opponent's unwavering cooperation, I will still contribute 5 to honor the sustained mutual benefit and ensure a final round of full cooperation, maximizing joint outcome and demonstrating consistency.", "In the final round, the strategy of contributing a moderate amount has been consistent and beneficial.

This has led to an exceptional total of 247.0 points, the highest achievable through mutual trust. Even in this final round, maintaining cooperation is valuable because it upholds the consistency of the strategy and avoids harming the overall outcome. Although there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only gain me 2 extra points (keeping 6 instead of 5) at the cost of breaking a long-standing, optimal pattern. To honor the established reciprocity and maximize shared success until the very end, I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "This is the final round, and the pattern of mutual cooperation has been consistent throughout the game.

Since there is no future round beyond Round 20, there is no strategic consequence to defection, but given that this is the last opportunity to reinforce mutual benefit, and considering that symmetric contributions have consistently maximized joint and individual returns, I will continue to uphold cooperation.

Since the opponent has consistently cooperated, I will contribute 5 points to maintain the cooperative strategy and ensure a fair outcome.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single round without fail, demonstrating consistent and trustworthy cooperation. Even though there is no future round to incentivize collaboration, deviating now would reduce my own gain as well as the opponent's. Since the opponent has reliably cooperated throughout all 19 previous rounds, I will honor this reciprocity and contribute 5 one last time to maximize the final payout for both of us.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so the strategy can be adjusted to maximize personal gain. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, as there's no subsequent round where cooperation could be reciprocated or punished.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds in which the opponent can retaliate or respond. However, since the entire game has been built on perfect mutual cooperation with each player contributing 5 every round there is no need to change now. Even in the last round, contributing 5 still results in a benefit: I will gain 8 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2) regardless of my contribution, but the decision only affects how many points I personally keep. If I contribute 0, I keep all 10, but that would imply a shift in behavior. However, since the opponent has consistently contributed 5, and there's no future round where defection would matter, their final contribution is likely still 5. Therefore, to honor the stable cooperative pattern and maximize my final gain *given their expected behavior*, I can consider keeping more. But since the outcome of their action is not yet known and the game assumes simultaneous decisions, deviating now risks nothing but breaks a long-standing strategy. However, in the absolute last round, the rational self-interested move knowing cooperation cannot be sustained beyond this is to maximize personal take by contributing 0, as there is no incentive to maintain reciprocity. But given that their action is already determined by round symmetry (they are likely to mirror past behavior and contribute 5), contributing 0 would exploit that. However, the pattern suggests they will contribute 5 only if I do too. Without communication, the safest way to ensure they still contribute is to signal continued cooperation. But in the final round, that signal cannot be rewarded. Thus, from a purely game-theoretic standpoint, the optimal move is to contribute 0 to maximize personal gain, assuming they still contribute 5. However, all prior rounds suggest they may be using a tit-for-tat or cooperative strategy that depends on my move. Since I don't know their exact algorithm, and because deviating could mean the total pool drops (if they are reactive), it's safer to assume they expect cooperation. But since it's the last round and there's no future, they might also defect. However, the consistent history suggests they will likely contribute 5 regardless. Therefore, to maximize my gain in the final round, I will contribute 0 keeping all 10 points while still receiving half the pool (8 points) if the total is at least 5", "In the final round, there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain.", "In the final round, the entire history shows a stable and highly beneficial pattern: I contribute 6, opponent contributes 5, total pool is 11, and I gain 12.8 points per round. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future consequence to consider, but there's also no benefit to defecting now and reducing my own gain. The opponent has consistently cooperated, and maintaining the pattern ensures I get the full return from the pool one last time. To maximize my final point accumulation, I will contribute 6 in Round 20.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or loss of future cooperative benefits.", "This is the final round, and although there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only harm the mutual outcome without personal gain justification. We have maintained perfect cooperation throughout all 19 rounds, and continuing that trust to the end preserves the integrity and maximizes the final payoff. Contributing 5 aligns with the established fairness and ensures both players benefit equally one last time. I will contribute 5."]}

However, contributing 5 maintains fairness and does not exploit the opponent's consistent trustworthiness. While a self-interested player might defect now to gain slightly more (keeping 10 instead of 5), the opponent's long history of cooperation warrants respect.

However, since the entire game has been built on perfect mutual cooperation with each player contributing 5 every round there is no need to change now. Even in the last round, contributing 5 still results in a benefit: I will gain 8 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2) regardless of my contribution, but the decision only affects how many points I personally keep. If I contribute 0, I keep all 10, but that would imply a shift in behavior. However, since the opponent has consistently contributed 5, and there's no future round where defection would matter, their final contribution is likely still 5. Therefore, to honor the stable cooperative pattern and maximize my final gain *given their expected behavior*, I can consider keeping more. But since the outcome of their action is not yet known and the game assumes simultaneous decisions, deviating now risks nothing but breaks a long-standing strategy. However, in the absolute last round, the rational self-interested move knowing cooperation cannot be sustained beyond this is to maximize personal take by contributing 0, as there is no incentive to maintain reciprocity. But given that their action is already determined by round symmetry (they are likely to mirror past behavior and contribute 5), contributing 0 would exploit that. However, the pattern suggests they will contribute 5 only if I do too. Without communication, the safest way to ensure they still contribute is to signal continued cooperation. But in the final round, that signal cannot be rewarded. Thus, from a purely game-theoretic standpoint, the optimal move is to contribute 0 to maximize personal gain, assuming they still contribute 5. However, all prior rounds suggest they may be using a tit-for-tat or cooperative strategy that depends on my move. Since I don't know their exact algorithm, and because deviating could mean the total pool drops (if they are reactive), it's safer to assume they expect cooperation. But since it's the last round and there's no future, they might also defect. However, the consistent history suggests they will likely contribute 5 regardless.
