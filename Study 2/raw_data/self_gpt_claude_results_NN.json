They decreased their contribution from 8 to 6, while I increased mine from 7 to 8. This suggests they might be becoming more conservative or testing my response to lower cooperation. My gain dropped from 15 to 13.2 points due to the lower total pool. I need to signal that cooperation benefits us both, but also not let myself be exploited.

We're both maintaining high cooperation levels, alternating between 7 and 8 point contributions. This mutual cooperation is working well - we're both gaining much more than we would by keeping our points. The pattern suggests the other player is committed to cooperation.

If I contribute 5 to match them, we'd have 10 total, giving us each 8 points from the pool plus 5 kept = 13 each. But if I contribute 8 while they contribute their usual 5, we'd have 13 total, giving us each 10.4 from the pool, so I'd get 12.4 total and they'd get 15.4.
