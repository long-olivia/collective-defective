My payoff was still good at 12.8 points (11 * 1.6 = 17.6, divided by 2 = 8.8 from pool, plus 4 kept = 12.8 total). Since the opponent seems locked into contributing 5, I should optimize around that. If I contribute 5 as well, we'd have 10 total, giving us each 8 from the pool plus 5 kept = 13 points each. This would be better for both of us than the current situation.

I will slightly lower my contribution to balance personal gain and encourage cooperation.", "Interesting - my opponent contributed 5 points in round 5 (9 total - 4 from me = 5 from them), returning to their previous level while I dropped to 4. This suggests they may have been testing me in round 4, and when I responded by matching their lower contribution, they went back up.

They seem to be consistently staying around 5 points, occasionally reaching 6 but dropping back. This appears to be their comfort zone for cooperation. Since we both gained well when contributing 5 each (13.0 and 13.8 points in recent rounds), and my gains decrease when I contribute more than them, I should return to 5 points.

I'll continue this strategy to maintain mutual gain.", "We've maintained a stable cooperative pattern for 6 rounds with excellent results. With 13 rounds remaining, I think it's worth testing if we can achieve even better mutual outcomes. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to signal that higher cooperation could benefit us both even more. If my opponent follows by increasing to 7 or 8, we'd both earn around 14.4-16 points per round instead of 13.4. If they don't respond positively, I can return to 7 in the next round.

This approach has proven effective for mutual benefit and sustained collaboration.", "We've now established a very stable pattern with three consecutive rounds of both players contributing exactly 6 points each. This has resulted in consistent gains of 13.6 points per round for both of us, which is excellent mutual benefit.
