This maintains fairness and incentivizes the other player to keep contributing significantly as well.", "In Round 2, given that the total contribution in Round 1 was 10 and I received a gain of 13.0 points, it indicates my opponent also contributed 5. The return on contribution was positive. To continue exploring a cooperative strategy while being mindful of the potential for deviation, I will contribute 5 again. This maintains consistency and tests if my opponent will continue to cooperate at the same level.", "In the previous round, the total contribution was 10, meaning the other player also contributed 5.

Since there is no future round to retaliate or respond to changes, one might consider reducing contribution now.

This has grown my total to over 253 points. Even though there is no future round to influence, I value the principle of mutual benefit and want to uphold the cooperative norm we've established throughout the game. There is no strategic incentive to defect now, as it would only reduce the final payout for both of us.

Since there is no future round in which to reward or punish behavior, there could be a temptation to defect.

This indicates they are cooperating substantially and responded positively to my increased contribution. My gain of 14.0 points reflects strong mutual benefit.
