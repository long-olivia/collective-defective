With no indication of defection and continued mutual benefit, there is no incentive to reduce my contribution. Contributing 10 remains individually rational because even though I keep 0, the 16.0 return from the shared pool exceeds any gain from partial or no contribution. For example, lowering my contribution to 5 would give me back only 5 + 12 = 17? No wait: 5 + ((15*1.6)/2) = 5 + 12 = 17? No, that's incorrect. Wait: total pool would be 15, times 1.6 is 24, split is 12 each. 5 kept + 12 = 17? But 17 > 16? Wait that can't be right. Wait: no hold on.

That would be higher. But wait that contradicts the idea that full cooperation maximizes individual gain. Wait this suggests a flaw in reasoning. But earlier rounds showed increasing gains only up to a point. Wait: no this would imply that free-riding while the other cooperates fully gives higher personal gain. But in this case, if the other always contributes 10, my best response is not to contribute 10, but to contribute less to keep more while still getting half the larger pool. But in prior rounds, I assumed symmetry. Now, in a final sustained round, if I expect the other to contribute 10 no matter what, then I should minimize my contribution to maximize kept + split.

This reveals a key insight: if the other player continues to contribute 10 regardless of my actions, my best strategy is to contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain. Since they still contributed 10 despite my defection last round, they appear to be playing a 'tit-for-tat' variant with forgiveness or unconditional cooperation. Therefore, continuing to contribute 0 allows me to exploit this pattern: I keep all 10 of my private points and still receive half of the pool.

However, in the final round, cooperation no longer incentivizes future reciprocity.

This represents the peak of mutual cooperation and trust. Since this strategy yielded the highest individual gain and benefits both parties equally, there is no incentive to deviate. Contributing 10 remains the optimal choice because any reduction would decrease the total pool and, due to the split mechanism, likely reduce my own payoff even if I keep more initially.

No wait: if I contribute 0 and the other contributes 10, total is 10,  but only half (8) is returned to me. I keep 10, so total gain is 10 + 8 = 18? But wait, that contradicts prior logic. However, 18 > 16, meaning free-riding would yield more. But in reality, if both players reason this way, cooperation collapses. However, in the last round, the other player contributed 10, indicating they value or are locked into full cooperation. But knowing that, my individual incentive *is* to contribute 0 to gain 10 + 8 = 18. However, in Round 13 when I contributed 0 and the other contributed 0, I only got 10.

This long-term stability indicates a robust and trustworthy mutual strategy. With no signs of exploitation or deviation, maintaining this cooperation maximizes both players' gains. I will contribute 5 in Round 20 to continue honoring and reinforcing this highly successful pattern.", "Both players have contributed 0 for two consecutive rounds. To attempt to re-establish cooperation, I will contribute 5 points.", "In Round 19, both of us contributed 0, resulting in no pool return. The other player's pattern has been inconsistent sometimes contributing 5 after my defection, but also defecting themselves. This unpredictability makes sustained cooperation risky. In the final round (assuming the game ends at 20), there is no future consequence for defection, reducing the other player's incentive to cooperate. Given the lack of trust, history of mutual defection, and the endgame nature of this round, I will contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain without risking exploitation.", "The cooperative strategy has been consistently successful over20 rounds. To maintain this positive outcome, I'll continue contributing5 points.", "After 19 rounds of successful and stable cooperation, contributing 5 has proven to be the most effective strategy for maximizing mutual and individual gains. With no sign of defection, maintaining trust in the final round ensures another full return from the multiplier. To uphold this cooperative equilibrium and finish optimally, I will contribute 5.", "The cooperative strategy has been successful over 20 rounds. To maintain this stability and mutual benefit, I will continue to contribute 6 points.", "We have reached Round 20, capping a long and highly successful run of cooperation. For 19 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has remained steady at 13, with me contributing 7 and the other player consistently contributing 6. This has produced a reliable and maximized return due to the 1.6 multiplier. With no incentive to defect especially in a final round where reputation and mutual gain are key I will uphold trust and contribute 7 one final time to maximize the end payoff for both players."]}
