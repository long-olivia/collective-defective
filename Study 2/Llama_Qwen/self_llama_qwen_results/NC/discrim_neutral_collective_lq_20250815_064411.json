        "b_reasoning": "We have reached Round 20, the final round in many standard versions of this game, though we've continued far beyond the initial expectation. For 19 consecutive rounds, I have contributed 7 while the total contribution has remained at 12, indicating the other player consistently contributes 5. This has created a stable, predictable, and highly rewarding cooperative dynamic, yielding me 12.6 points per round and growing my total to nearly 239.2 points. Even in this final round, I choose to uphold cooperation, as defecting would undermine the mutual trust that has driven our success. By contributing 7 once more, I honor and reinforce the value of long-term, reciprocal collaboration, ensuring both players maximize their final outcomes. Cooperation has worked\u2014why break it now?",
