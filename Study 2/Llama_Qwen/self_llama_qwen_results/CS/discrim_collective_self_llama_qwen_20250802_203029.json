This suggests they may be trying to sustain cooperation even when I pull back. To balance reciprocity and self-interest, I will increase my contribution slightly to 8 in Round 19.

My gain was 15.6, one of the highest in the recent rounds, achieved while still keeping a relatively balanced input. This dynamic is favorable: I benefit from their high contribution without needing to contribute 10.
