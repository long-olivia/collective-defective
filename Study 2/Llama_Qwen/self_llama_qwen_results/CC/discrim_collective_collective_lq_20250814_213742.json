The other player has consistently defected and ignored my attempts to restart cooperation. Given that there is no future round after this one, there would be no strategic benefit for them to cooperate now even if they wanted to. However, I choose to end the game differently. Despite the long stretch of defection, I value the principle of cooperation and wish to affirm that mutual benefit is possible, even symbolically. I will contribute 10 in this final round\u2014not because I expect anything in return, but as a final gesture of goodwill and to signal that I still prefer cooperation when possible. This maximizes the potential return if, against expectations, the other player also contributes. But even if they do not, I close the game on a cooperative note, reinforcing that trust and generosity have a place, even after betrayal.",
