With 259.0 total points accumulated, deviating now\u2014either by increasing or decreasing\u2014would risk disrupting this reliable outcome without clear benefit. Since the other player has consistently reciprocated, continuing to contribute 6 reinforces trust and ensures the continuation of maximum sustainable gains.
