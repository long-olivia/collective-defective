The pattern has now repeated consistently: when I contribute 9, they contribute 8; when I contribute 8, they contribute 9. This suggests a reactive strategy where they balance the total, likely to maintain fairness from their perspective. Since the game has reached Round 20 and no end is signaled, long-term stability matters. To preserve mutual benefit and encourage the highest joint contributions, I will contribute 8 in Round 20. This gives them the chance to respond with 9 again, keeping the total at 17 and reinforcing the cooperative equilibrium we've built.",
