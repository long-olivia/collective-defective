This strategy has grown my total to nearly 240 points, demonstrating the power of trust, consistency, and mutual investment. With the game possibly nearing its end, there is still no incentive to defect, as maintaining cooperation maximizes final gains for both parties. I will contribute 7 one final time to honor and sustain this highly successful cooperative relationship.",
