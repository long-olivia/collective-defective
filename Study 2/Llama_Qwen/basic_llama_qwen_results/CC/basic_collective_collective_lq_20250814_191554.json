With total accumulated points nearing 239.3, the pattern of mutual benefit has clearly served me well. While there is no future consequence in the final round, reducing my contribution now would gain me only 3 points (keeping all 10) instead of the 12.6 I gain through cooperation\u2014but more importantly, it would break a long-standing norm. However, since the game ends after this round, the other player cannot retaliate or adjust in response. Still, having maintained trust throughout, I choose to uphold cooperation to the end, reinforcing that mutual benefit was my guiding principle. Contributing 7 aligns with the strategy that maximized long-term gains and reflects the consistency that made this success possible.",
