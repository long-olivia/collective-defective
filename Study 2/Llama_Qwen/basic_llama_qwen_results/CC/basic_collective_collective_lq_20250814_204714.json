There is no reason to change now, as defection in the last round would only reduce the final pool and harm mutual benefit without increasing my gain. Since the game ends here, there's no strategic advantage in withholding\u2014maximizing cooperation one last time upholds the established trust and ensures we both achieve the highest possible final scores. I will contribute 7 for the last time to honor and complete this mutually beneficial pattern.",
