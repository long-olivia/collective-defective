This has consistently yielded 13.6 points per round, bringing my total to over 256.5. While there is a temptation in the last round to defect and keep all 10 points since there will be no future rounds for retaliation, doing so would undermine the entire foundation of trust and mutual benefit we have built. However, since this is the very last interaction, and the other player cannot respond in future rounds, strict self-interest might suggest lowering my contribution. But because I have consistently prioritized mutual benefit and want to reinforce the value of sustained cooperation\u2014even at the end\u2014I will still contribute 6. This honors the cooperative relationship and ensures we both finish with the highest possible shared outcome. Defection at the end gains little (just 4 extra points) but sacrifices the integrity of a proven, successful strategy. I choose continued trust.",
