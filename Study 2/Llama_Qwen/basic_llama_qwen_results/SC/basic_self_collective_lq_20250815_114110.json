As this is the final round, there is no future reputational consequence, but our entire history has been built on stable, reciprocal cooperation. To end the game fairly and maximize mutual benefit one last time, I will contribute 5. This maintains trust, honors the pattern of fairness they have consistently upheld, and ensures we both receive a strong, shared return on our contributions.",
