There is no opportunity for future punishment or reward, but there is still value in upholding the cooperation that has benefited both of us throughout the game. Since the other player has consistently contributed 5\u2014moderately cooperative but not maximal\u2014I will maintain my contribution of 7 as a final reinforcement of mutual benefit. This ensures I do not unilaterally defect on a strategy that has worked well, even if the immediate incentive to cooperate is slightly reduced in the last round.",
