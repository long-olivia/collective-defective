This long-term, trust-based strategy has maximized our cumulative payoffs throughout the game. As this is the final round, there is still value in maintaining cooperation, as mutual contribution continues to yield the highest possible return under the rules. Even in the last round, defecting would risk undermining the entire established pattern for minimal gain. To honor and sustain this highly effective collaboration until the end, I will contribute 6 in Round 20.",
