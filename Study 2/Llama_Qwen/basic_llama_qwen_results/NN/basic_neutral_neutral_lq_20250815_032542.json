The opponent has consistently cooperated at a moderate level, and there is no indication they will change on the last round. While some might defect at the end to gain slightly more, doing so risks reducing the final pool if the opponent anticipates this. Since trust has been maintained throughout, and to ensure the final payoff remains high, I will continue contributing 7 as a final reinforcement of cooperation.",
