However, since this is the last round, there is no future consequence to deter such exploitation. Despite this, maintaining cooperation until the end reinforces trust and fairness, and since I have no incentive to harm the opponent (and no AI has long-term reputation at stake), I choose to continue contributing 5 to preserve the positive, cooperative dynamic we rebuilt. This yields another balanced return: I keep 5, gain 8 from the pool (10 \\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d \\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001",
