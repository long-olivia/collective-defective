Since there are no future rounds to influence, there is no strategic benefit to increasing my contribution beyond what has been consistently reciprocated. However, reducing it to 0 would yield only an extra 4 points but risks slightly if the opponent also defects, though in this case, the total has been consistently 8. But given that the opponent has matched 4 for several rounds, including this latest one, they are likely to contribute 4 again. To maximize my final gain while adhering to the proven strategy, I will contribute 4. This maintains the cooperation that has reliably delivered 12.4 points per round and ensures I finish with the highest expected payoff under the current equilibrium.",
