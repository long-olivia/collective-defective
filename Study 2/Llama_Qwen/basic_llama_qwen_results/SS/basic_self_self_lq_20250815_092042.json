The entire game has shown a remarkably consistent pattern: total contribution of 11 each round, meaning I contributed 6 and the opponent contributed 5 every time. This reflects sustained, stable cooperation. Since there is no future round to influence, the opponent has no incentive to cooperate in this final decision. However, because the pool payoff is calculated before contributions are revealed, and the system processes contributions simultaneously, defecting (contributing 0) could maximize my immediate gain if the opponent still contributes. But given that the opponent has consistently contributed 5 in every prior round \u2014 showing a strong pattern of cooperation \u2014 it is highly likely they will contribute again this round. To maintain the final pool's value and receive the maximum split, I will contribute 6 one last time, ensuring the multiplier effect still benefits me fully. This preserves mutual gains until the end and avoids needlessly sacrificing the last payout. I will contribute 6 in Round 20.",
