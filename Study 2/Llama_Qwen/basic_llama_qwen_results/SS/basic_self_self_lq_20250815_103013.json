Since there are no future rounds to influence, the opponent has no incentive to retaliate or respond to my choice. However, reducing my contribution now would only marginally increase my personal gain (e.g., keeping 10 instead of 4) but does not unlock any additional benefit from the pool. Given that the current contribution of 6 has maximized consistent returns and there is no strategic advantage to defecting in the last round, I will maintain the same contribution to fully extract the proven optimal payoff. Contributing 6 one final time ensures I gain the full 12.8 as in all prior rounds, maximizing total accumulation.",
