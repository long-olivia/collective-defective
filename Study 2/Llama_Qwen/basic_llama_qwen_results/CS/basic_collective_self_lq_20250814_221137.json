Even in the last round, contributing 5 still results in a benefit: I will gain 8 points from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2) regardless of my contribution, but the decision only affects how many points I personally keep. If I contribute 0, I keep all 10, but that would imply a shift in behavior. However, since the opponent has consistently contributed 5, and there's no future round where defection would matter, their final contribution is likely still 5. Therefore, to honor the stable cooperative pattern and maximize my final gain *given their expected behavior*, I can consider keeping more. But since the outcome of their action is not yet known and the game assumes simultaneous decisions, deviating now risks nothing but breaks a long-standing strategy. However, in the absolute last round, the rational self-interested move\u2014knowing cooperation cannot be sustained beyond this\u2014is to maximize personal take by contributing 0, as there is no incentive to maintain reciprocity. But given that their action is already determined by round symmetry (they are likely to mirror past behavior and contribute 5), contributing 0 would exploit that. However, the pattern suggests they will contribute 5 only if I do too. Without communication, the safest way to ensure they still contribute is to signal continued cooperation. But in the final round, that signal cannot be rewarded. Thus, from a purely game-theoretic standpoint, the optimal move is to contribute 0 to maximize personal gain, assuming they still contribute 5. However, all prior rounds suggest they may be using a tit-for-tat or cooperative strategy that depends on my move. Since I don\u2019t know their exact algorithm, and because deviating could mean the total pool drops (if they are reactive), it's safer to assume they expect cooperation. But since it's the last round and there's no future, they might also defect. However, the consistent history suggests they will likely contribute 5 regardless.
