Since cooperation can no longer be sustained beyond this point, it becomes optimal to maximize my own gain unilaterally. The opponent has consistently contributed 5, suggesting they may do so again. By contributing 0 now, I keep all 10 points and still gain half of the pool if they contribute. This maximizes my individual payoff with minimal risk. Deviating in the final round is a well-known strategy in repeated games to exploit established trust without consequence. I will contribute 0 to maximize my final point accumulation.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain in this last round.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The opponent has contributed exactly 5 in every single previous round, demonstrating perfect and consistent cooperation. This has maximized our mutual gains throughout the game. While there is no future retaliation to fear in a final round, deviating now by contributing less would only marginally increase my immediate take while reducing the total pool and undermining 19 rounds of trust. Since the opponent has proven to be fair and predictable, I will maintain cooperation one last time and contribute 5 to honor the stable, mutually beneficial pattern we've established.", "In the final round, there's no future round to influence, so the strategy can focus solely on maximizing the final gain. However, maintaining cooperation until the end has been beneficial, so I'll contribute 5.", "This is the final round, Round 20, and the entire game has been characterized by perfect mutual cooperation: both players consistently contributing 5 points each round, resulting in a proven and maximized gain of 13.0 points per round. This has led to a total of 247.0 points. Since there will be no future rounds, there is no opportunity for retaliation or reputational consequences. However, contributing 5 again maintains consistency and ensures both players receive the same proven benefit. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect, as mutual cooperation has already been the optimal strategy throughout. To honor this effective equilibrium and secure the final 13.0 points, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In the final round, the strategy of contributing to the public pool is still relevant as it directly impacts the final points. Given that we've cooperated throughout and there's no future round to consider retaliation or cooperation, I'll contribute 5 points to maintain the pattern and ensure a fair outcome.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed exactly 5 points in all 19 previous rounds, demonstrating consistent and reliable cooperation. Throughout the game, this mutual 5-point contribution has yielded a stable gain of 13.0 points per round, resulting in 247.0 points so far. Even in the last round, cooperation still provides the highest guaranteed return. Since there is no opportunity for the opponent to retaliate or change strategy after this round, and given their long-standing pattern of fairness, I will continue to contribute 5 to maximize final shared gains and uphold the successful cooperative strategy that has defined this game.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 to maximize my final gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or impact on future cooperation.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The opponent has contributed exactly 5 points in every single round, resulting in a total pool of 12 each time. Their strategy is clearly fixed and predictable. My contribution of 7 has consistently yielded 12.6 points per round, which is the highest sustainable gain given their behavior. Since there is no future round to influence, one might consider defecting to gain slightly more personally. However, since the pool split is simultaneous and the outcome is already determined by both players' choices, and given that the opponent shows no sign of changing, maintaining 7 ensures I receive the full benefit of the 1.6 multiplier on the pool as in all prior rounds. There is no strategic advantage in deviating now. To maximize final payoff, I will contribute 7 one last time.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to benefit from cooperation. Given that there's no subsequent round where not contributing could impact the opponent's strategy, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain in this last round.", "This is the final round, and there will be no future rounds to retaliate or respond. The opponent has contributed 5 in every single round, showing a pattern of full cooperation until the end. However, since there is no future consequence, contributing less would increase my personal gain without risk of retaliation. If I contribute 0, I keep all 10 points, and the pool will consist only of the opponent's 5, which multiplied by 1.6 becomes 8, split as 4 to each. I would gain 10 (kept) + 4 (from pool) = 14, better than the usual 13. Since this is the last opportunity and cooperation cannot be reciprocated further, I maximize my personal accumulation by defecting. I will contribute 0 to secure the highest possible final gain.", "In the final round, there is no opportunity for future cooperation or retaliation. Given that there is no incentive to contribute to the pool as the game ends, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both I and the opponent have consistently contributed 5, resulting in a perfectly balanced and cooperative game. Since there is no future round in which to punish or reward the opponent's behavior, there is a theoretical temptation to defect now and keep all 10 points. However, given that the opponent has demonstrated persistent cooperation, they may have used a tit-for-tat or fair strategy that assumes continuity. Moreover, without knowing their exact logic, deviating now risks undermining their cooperation in this last instance. To honor the established pattern and ensure I don't lose out on the shared gain one final time, I will contribute 5, securing another 8 from the split pool. This maintains consistency and maximizes expected payoff under mutual cooperation until the very end.", "In the final round, the strategy remains the same as in the previous rounds. Since cooperation has been consistently mutual and beneficial, I will contribute 5 points to maintain the cooperative stance until the end.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both players have cooperated perfectly, contributing 5 points each time. This has resulted in a highly profitable and stable relationship. Even in the final round, maintaining cooperation yields the best combined outcome. While there is no future round to incentivize trust, deviating now would only gain me slightly more at the cost of mutual loss. To honor the established pattern and maximize shared gains until the end, I will contribute 5.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been characterized by perfect cooperation with mutual 5-point contributions. Since there is no future round to retaliate or respond, the opponent might be tempted to defect now. However, since I have no opportunity to respond afterward either, deviating from cooperation would only reduce the final payout if the opponent still values fairness. Given the consistent pattern, it's reasonable to assume they will contribute 5 again. To honor the established reciprocity and ensure we both maximize final gains, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In the final round, there's no risk of retaliation or loss of cooperation in subsequent rounds. However, the established mutual cooperation has been beneficial, so I will contribute 5 points as in previous rounds to maintain the cooperative outcome until the end.", "Over all 19 previous rounds, the opponent has consistently contributed 5, maintaining perfect cooperation and maximizing mutual returns. With this trust demonstrated throughout the game, there is no incentive to defect in the final round--doing so would reduce the shared pool and harm overall accumulation without meaningful strategic advantage.

Both players have cooperated by contributing5 points each round. To maintain this cooperation and maximize our final gains, I will contribute5 points.", "Throughout all 19 rounds, mutual cooperation with 5-point contributions has consistently yielded the maximum possible return of 13.0 points per round, resulting in 247.0 total points. This trust-based strategy has been remarkably successful. Even in the final round, there is no benefit to deviating--doing so would only reduce my own gain without increasing my advantage, since the opponent has reliably cooperated. To fully honor and capitalize on this sustained cooperation, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. I will contribute 0 points as there's no future round to maintain cooperation for, and I can maximize my points by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and there is no future consequence for defection, which could tempt a strategic reduction in contribution. However, the opponent has consistently contributed 5 throughout all 19 rounds, showing a strong pattern of fairness and cooperation. Maintaining reciprocity until the end preserves the established trust and ensures I don't forfeit potential gains by unilaterally defecting. Since the opponent is likely to cooperate again this round, contributing 5 maximizes my guaranteed return. I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute0 points to maximize my personal gain.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single round, showing consistent cooperation. Since there are no future rounds to influence, there is no further incentive for them to retaliate if I reduce my contribution. To maximize my own point accumulation, I will keep all 10 points and contribute 0 in this last round, gaining the full 10 points while still receiving half of the multiplied pool. This ensures the highest possible final score.", "Since this is the last round, there's no future incentive to cooperate. The rational choice is to maximize my personal gain by not contributing to the public pool, as there's no risk of retaliation or loss of future cooperation. I will contribute 0 points.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, a stable and highly cooperative norm has been established, with both players consistently contributing 5 points. There is no sign of exploitation or incentive to defect until now. Even in the final round, maintaining cooperation yields a fair and maximized return when both contribute equally. Since this behavior has been consistently rewarded, I will continue to contribute 5 to honor the established reciprocity and ensure I do not unilaterally undermine a strategy that has proven optimal.", "Since this is the last round, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain, as there will be no future rounds to consider for mutual cooperation.", "In the final round, the opponent has consistently contributed 5 in every single round, matching my cooperation perfectly throughout the game. While there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, deviating now by contributing less would only gain me a small immediate advantage but goes against the established pattern of fairness and reciprocity that has maximized long-term gains. However, since this is the last round and retaliation cannot affect future rounds, some game-theoretic models suggest defecting. But given the opponent's unwavering cooperation, I will still contribute 5 to honor the sustained mutual benefit and ensure a final round of full cooperation, maximizing joint outcome and demonstrating consistency.", "In the final round, there's no future round to influence, so the decision comes down to maximizing the current round's gain. Since the opponent has consistently cooperated, I will contribute 5 points to maintain the cooperative strategy and ensure a fair outcome.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single round without fail, demonstrating consistent and trustworthy cooperation. Even though there is no future round to incentivize collaboration, deviating now would reduce my own gain as well as the opponent's.

We have maintained perfect cooperation throughout all 19 rounds, and continuing that trust to the end preserves the integrity and maximizes the final payoff. Contributing 5 aligns with the established fairness and ensures both players benefit equally one last time. I will contribute 5."]}
