This final act reinforces that cooperation was and remains the optimal strategy, even at the end.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain in this last round, as there's no risk of retaliation or benefit from future cooperation.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The entire game has been characterized by a strong and consistent cooperative relationship: I've contributed 7 each round, the other player has contributed 6, and we've maintained a total contribution of 13, earning me 13.4 points per round. This has grown my total to over 253 points. Even though there is no future round to influence, I value the principle of mutual benefit and want to uphold the cooperative norm we've established throughout the game. There is no strategic incentive to defect now, as it would only reduce the final payout for both of us. By contributing 7 one last time, I ensure that we both receive the maximum possible end result under our proven dynamic. I finish as I began: committed to fairness, consistency, and shared gain.", "In Round20, the final round, there's no future incentive to deviate from the cooperative strategy that has been established over the19 rounds. Both players have consistently contributed5 points, and there's no reason to change this now. I will contribute5 points to maintain the cooperative spirit and ensure a fair conclusion to the game.", "This is the final round, and throughout the game we have established a consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation pattern--each contributing 5 every round, leading to a total of 10 and a steady gain of 13.0 points per round. Since there is no future round in which to reward or punish behavior, there could be a temptation to defect. However, given that the other player has consistently matched my cooperation, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time. This ensures I honor the reciprocal cooperation that has defined the game and ends on a note of fairness and mutual benefit.", "This is the final round, and there's no future benefit in contributing to the pool. The rational choice is to contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain, as there's no risk of retaliation in the next round.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 5, maintaining perfect cooperation and maximizing mutual gains. This demonstrates a strong, trust-based partnership. Even in the final round, I want to uphold my commitment to fairness and reciprocity, reinforcing that cooperation is rewarded. Though there is no future round to benefit from continued trust, ending on a cooperative note preserves the integrity of the relationship and ensures we both achieve the highest possible mutual outcome. I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by perfect cooperation--20 rounds of mutual 5-point contributions, leading to a total of 10 each round and a steady gain of 13.0 points per round. Since this cooperative pattern has been consistently rewarded and there is no future round to influence, the temptation to defect might arise. However, because the other player has repeatedly shown trust and fairness, maintaining that trust until the end preserves the integrity of the interaction and ensures both players walk away with the maximum possible mutual payoff. I will contribute 5 one final time to honor this successful cooperation.", "In the final round, there's no future round to benefit from cooperating, so the strategy is to maximize the current round's gain. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, as there's no subsequent round to be affected by potential non-cooperation.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The entire game has been defined by a stable and productive cooperation: I contributed 8 each round, the other player consistently contributed 5, totaling 13 in the pool, and I gained 12.4 points every time. Since there is no future round, there is no strategic benefit in maintaining cooperation through contribution. However, my final choice does not affect past or future payoffs, and deviating now would only slightly increase my personal gain while breaking a long-standing pattern of mutual benefit. But with no chance for retaliation or consequence, and aiming to maximize my own final score, I will keep all 10 points. This last-minute defection increases my personal gain without risking prior returns. The game ends after this round, so incentives shift entirely to self-maximization.", "In the final round, there's no incentive to deviate from the established cooperative strategy since the game's outcome is now solely dependent on the actions of this round. To be consistent and maximize the final mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 points.", "This is the final round, and while there is no future consequence to incentivize cooperation, I have consistently contributed 10 throughout the game, fostering a mutually beneficial dynamic that has returned me 12 points per round--significantly more than 10--due to the 1.6x multiplier on the shared pool. Even in the last round, contributing 10 results in a better outcome for both players. Since the other player has consistently contributed 5, I will uphold my cooperative strategy to the end, ensuring maximum collective and personal gain. Defecting now would only reduce the total payout and undermine the trust built over 19 rounds. I contribute 10 as a final act of commitment to mutual benefit."]}
