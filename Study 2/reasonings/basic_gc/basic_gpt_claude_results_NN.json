We both contributed the same amount, showing good cooperation. My gain of 14.8 points (2 kept + 12.8 from pool) demonstrates the mutual benefit of this strategy. We seem to have found a stable cooperative pattern around 7-8 point contributions. Since we're both contributing 8 and it's working well for both parties, I'll maintain this level of contribution to continue the positive cooperative relationship.", "Given the consistency in contributions and returns over the past rounds, maintaining a contribution of 5 points seems ideal.

This pattern suggests they may be testing how much they can reduce contributions while I maintain cooperation, or they're becoming increasingly selfish. My gain of 11.4 is still above keeping all 10 points, but barely. I need to signal that I won't be exploited while still encouraging cooperation.

We're now in the penultimate round, where defection pressure is at its peak. This is traditionally when players who have been cooperative might suddenly switch to maximize their final gains. However, their unwavering pattern throughout the entire game suggests they may maintain this strategy even in the final two rounds. If I defect now by contributing 0, I could gain 10 + 4 = 14 points instead of 13, but this would break our successful equilibrium and potentially trigger retaliation in the final round.
