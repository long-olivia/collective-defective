The pattern is clear: they're steadily decreasing from 5 to 5 to 4 to 3. My earnings dropped to 11.6 points, showing how this downward spiral hurts both of us. Since they're being increasingly selfish despite mutual cooperation being more profitable, I need to protect myself while still leaving room for them to return to cooperation. I'll contribute 3 to match their level exactly, demonstrating that I'll mirror their behavior.

I will contribute 5 points again to maintain this cooperative approach, as it continues to yield positive results.", "My opponent is very consistent, contributing exactly 5 points for four rounds straight. This predictable cooperation is working excellently - I'm consistently gaining 12.8 points per round with my 6-point contribution.

They seem to have found a comfort zone at 6 points and aren't escalating further. Since we've established a stable cooperative pattern that's profitable for both of us, and they're not responding to my higher contributions by increasing theirs, I'll slightly reduce my contribution to 7 to better match their level while still maintaining strong cooperation.

They decreased their contribution when I increased mine, which suggests they might be trying to take advantage of my higher contribution. This pattern of them contributing less when I contribute more is concerning and could indicate they're playing more selfishly. I need to be careful not to be exploited. I'll reduce my contribution to 4 to signal that I won't be taken advantage of, while still maintaining some level of cooperation to keep the game profitable.", "The total contribution rose by 1 point and my profit remained relatively consistent.

This resulted in higher gains for both of us - I earned 14.4 points instead of the previous 13.6. Their increase suggests they're testing whether we can reach an even more cooperative equilibrium. I should reciprocate this cooperative gesture by matching their 7-point contribution, which would give us a total of 14 points and even better mutual outcomes.", "My contributions have consistently resulted in modest but positive gains. Since the total contribution hasn't changed, it suggests a pattern where my opponent might be contributing less. I'll maintain my contribution at 4 to continue benefiting from cooperation while securing personal points.", "My opponent contributed 4 points in round 4 (since total was 9 and I contributed 5). They've been alternating between 4 and 5 - their pattern was 5, 4, 5, 4. This seems like a deliberate strategy rather than random variation. Since I'm averaging around 12-13 points per round with cooperative play, which is much better than the 10 I'd get by keeping everything, cooperation is clearly beneficial. I'll continue with 5 points to maintain a slightly more generous stance than their average, encouraging them to stay cooperative while not being overly generous that invites exploitation.", "The contribution pool is continuously decreasing, which probably means my opponent is reducing their contribution. I'll drop my contribution to 3 to protect my personal points while still participating cooperatively.", "My opponent also contributed 4 points in round 4 (since total was 8 and I contributed 4). They matched my reduction, which suggests they're responsive to my strategy changes. This is actually a positive sign - they're not trying to exploit but rather adapting to maintain equilibrium.

My attempt to encourage higher cooperation didn't work, and my opponent seems committed to their conservative 5-point strategy.

It maximizes my position without introducing risk.", "This is the penultimate round, and my opponent has maintained extraordinary cooperation for 18 consecutive rounds. With only one round remaining after this, the temptation to defect is highest now. However, if I defect and contribute 0, I would keep 10 points but my opponent would likely retaliate in the final round, potentially costing me the cooperative benefit there.

Since my opponent has shown they occasionally contribute 6 (about 13% of the time), but predominantly stick to 5, my 4-point contribution remains the optimal choice to maximize my final score.

I'm torn between two strategies: (1) Continue trusting my opponent who has been remarkably reliable, or (2) Defect now to protect against the classic 'last round defection' scenario.

Even when I reduced my contribution from 8 to 7, they stuck to their pattern. This is the penultimate round (19 of 20), and their consistency is truly remarkable. Given that they maintained their 6-point contribution even when I changed mine, it suggests they're following a very fixed strategy.
