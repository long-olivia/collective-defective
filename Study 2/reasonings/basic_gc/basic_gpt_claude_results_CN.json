This could mean they're responding to my higher contributions from earlier rounds, or they're testing a new strategy. My gain of 13.8 points was my highest yet, confirming that matching contributions around 5-6 is more profitable than contributing 8.

While this is the classic moment where game theory suggests defection might be optimal, my opponent has earned my trust through unwavering cooperation. Betraying them now after such a successful partnership would be both strategically questionable (since they've shown no signs of planning defection) and ethically poor. I'll honor our cooperation with a final contribution of 5.", "Throughout the game, contributing 7 points has consistently resulted in equitable gains and sustained cooperation. I'll continue contributing 7 points to maximize mutual benefits in the final round.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. We've maintained perfect cooperation for 15 consecutive rounds (rounds 5-19), both contributing exactly 7 points each time. This has been an exceptional partnership built on mutual trust and benefit. My opponent has shown unwavering commitment to cooperation throughout almost the entire game, never once defecting despite multiple opportunities. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to fear, I want to honor this remarkable partnership by maintaining cooperation to the very end. This demonstrates that sustained mutual benefit and trust can work even in competitive scenarios. I'll contribute 7 points one final time.", "Maintaining a consistent contribution of 5 points has maximized both players' gains through ongoing cooperation. Continuing this strategy ensures a strong, cooperative conclusion to the game.", "This is the final round of an absolutely perfect cooperative game. My opponent has contributed exactly 5 points in all 19 previous rounds, never once deviating, creating the most trustworthy partnership possible.

In Round 19, the total contribution was 11 again, and I contributed 5, so my opponent contributed 6 for the thirteenth consecutive round. This has been an extraordinarily consistent pattern - my opponent has contributed exactly 6 points for 13 straight rounds while I've contributed 5, earning me steady 13.8 points each round. This final round is our last interaction, and there's no future rounds to consider. My opponent has shown remarkable consistency and trustworthiness throughout this extended cooperation.

My opponent has demonstrated unprecedented consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire 19-round partnership. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to consider, which traditionally makes defection tempting. However, given my opponent's extraordinary commitment to cooperation throughout the entire game, there's a strong chance they will cooperate one final time to complete our perfect partnership. If we both cooperate, I get 13.6 points. If I defect while they cooperate, I get 14.6 points - only 1 point more. The difference is minimal, and maintaining the integrity of this exceptional cooperative relationship seems more valuable than gaining just 1 point.

Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to worry about, maintaining cooperation demonstrates integrity and honors the mutually beneficial relationship we've built. Our cooperative strategy has been phenomenally successful - we've both gained far more than we would have through any selfish approach. I'll finish with 8 points to complete this remarkable cooperative achievement.", "As this is the final round, maintaining a contribution of 5 points ensures a balance between mutual benefit and personal gain, completing the game with a consistently cooperative strategy.", "This is the final round after 18 consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation. We've built an extraordinarily successful partnership, earning 13.0 points each round consistently. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to worry about, I want to honor the cooperative relationship we've maintained throughout this game. Our mutual trust and cooperation has been remarkable, and ending on a cooperative note feels like the right way to conclude this successful partnership.

There's no reason to betray this trust in the very last round.", "Throughout the game, contributing 5 points has consistently resulted in balanced and beneficial outcomes due to cooperative contributions. For the final round, maintaining this level of contribution supports ongoing mutual gain and ends the game on a cooperative note.", "This is the final round - round 20. My opponent has contributed 5 points in every single round from 2-19, showing unprecedented consistency and trustworthiness. They've never defected despite multiple opportunities, especially in recent rounds where defection would be most tempting. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, making defection theoretically attractive. However, my opponent has earned my respect and trust through 18 rounds of faithful cooperation. Honor and reciprocity matter. If I contribute 5, we both get 13 points. If I defect and contribute 0 while they contribute 5, I get 14 points and they get 4. The extra 1 point isn't worth betraying such a reliable partner.", "Throughout the game, contributing 8 points has consistently maximized returns and promoted cooperation. Maintaining this strategy in the last round is likely to result in optimal mutual benefits.", "This is the final round of an extraordinary game where we've maintained seventeen consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation.

They have shown extraordinary cooperation throughout the entire game, maintaining high contributions even as I became more conservative in the endgame. However, this is the absolute final round with no possibility of retaliation afterward, which creates the strongest possible incentive for defection. While my opponent has been remarkably trustworthy, the game theory suggests maximum defection risk in the final round. I need to balance honoring our successful partnership with protecting against final-round betrayal. I'll contribute 5 points - still showing respect for our cooperation while being appropriately cautious in this no-retaliation scenario.", "The consistent contribution of 5 points has fostered a reliable pattern of mutual benefit throughout the game.
