They've dropped to their lowest contribution yet despite my attempt to gradually rebuild cooperation. The pattern shows they consistently exploit any generosity I show - when I contributed 3, they dropped to 1. My gain fell to 10.2, barely better than keeping everything. This opponent appears to be following a exploitative strategy, contributing minimally while hoping I'll contribute more. I need to match their minimal effort to avoid being taken advantage of.
