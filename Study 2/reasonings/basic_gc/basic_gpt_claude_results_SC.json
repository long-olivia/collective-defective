My ongoing strategy of contributing 0 remains optimal to maximize my points.", "This is the penultimate round, our eighth consecutive round of mutual defection. With only one round remaining after this, my opponent has definitively shown they will not cooperate. They've maintained zero contributions throughout the entire endgame despite multiple earlier opportunities for mutual benefit. Any contribution now would simply be giving away points with no possibility of reciprocal benefit in the final round. I'll continue with 0 contribution to maximize my final score.", "Given the consistent outcome of acquiring maximum points with zero contributions from both players, I will maintain this strategy in order to continue optimizing my points.", "My opponent contributed 0 points in round 18, continuing the mutual defection pattern. I gained 10 points (0 from pool + 10 kept). With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, and my opponent having consistently shown zero willingness to cooperate despite numerous attempts throughout the game, there's no reason to change strategy now. Contributing anything would only reduce my final score with no possibility of building cooperation in just one remaining round after this.", "The ongoing strategy of contributing 6 points has continued to yield favorable outcomes with no indication of a need for change. It is beneficial to maintain this approach, so I will contribute 6 points again.", "Seventeen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation demonstrates an incredible partnership built on mutual trust. With only 2 rounds remaining, the temptation to defect is at its highest, but my opponent has shown unwavering reliability throughout the entire game. If I defect now and they retaliate in the final round, we'd both lose the cooperative benefit. Even with one round left after this, maintaining trust could lead to mutual cooperation through the end.

We're in the penultimate round with just 2 rounds remaining including this one. Our 8-8 pattern has been extremely successful and stable. Since we've both consistently honored this arrangement and there are so few rounds left, the risk of defection is low and the benefit of continued cooperation is clear. I'll maintain 8 points to preserve this excellent partnership through to the very end.", "With the game nearing its end, maintaining a consistent strategy that has been providing stable returns is beneficial. I will continue to contribute 4 points.", "My opponent contributed 4 points in Round 18 (8 total - 4 from me = 4 from them), maintaining our symmetric cooperation for the third consecutive round. With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, we've established a stable and fair pattern. Both players are consistently earning 12.4 points per round, which significantly exceeds the 10 points from selfish play. There's no strategic reason to deviate now - changing my contribution in the penultimate round could destabilize our successful cooperation and potentially lead to retaliation in the final round. I'll stick with 4 points to maintain this proven mutually beneficial strategy.", "The current strategy of contributing 6 points has been consistently beneficial. As we approach the game's end, maintaining this level of contribution continues to ensure fairness and mutual gain.", "Sixteen consecutive rounds of perfect 6-6 cooperation have created an absolutely remarkable partnership throughout almost the entire game. We've both consistently earned 13.6 points per round, demonstrating extraordinary mutual trust and sustained benefit. My opponent has maintained unwavering cooperation even into the penultimate round, showing exceptional commitment to our partnership. With only 1 round remaining after this, I want to honor this incredible cooperative relationship and continue demonstrating trustworthiness.

With just one round left after this, there's zero chance of establishing any meaningful cooperative dynamic.

As we near the end of the game, maintaining the same strategy by contributing 5 points should continue to yield positive results.", "My opponent contributed 5 points again in round 18 (10 total - 5 from me = 5 from them). We've now had thirteen consecutive rounds of perfect 5-5 cooperation, consistently earning 13.0 points each round. This is an absolutely extraordinary level of sustained cooperation that has been incredibly successful. With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, we're in the critical endgame phase. The penultimate round is often when defection begins in these games. However, my opponent has demonstrated such unwavering reliability and commitment to cooperation that I believe maintaining our successful pattern is still the best strategy.

The opponent has shown absolute commitment to non-cooperation in the endgame. With only 2 rounds remaining, any cooperation attempt would be extremely high-risk with minimal potential reward. In game theory, the final rounds create strong incentives for defection since there's little opportunity for future retaliation or relationship building.

There's no future reputation to protect, but completing this partnership with integrity reflects the spirit of mutual benefit that has served us both so well.", "In the final round, I will stick to my current strategy of minimal contribution to secure my points, as the declining total contributions do not incentivize increasing cooperation.", "The opponent contributed 3 points in round 19 (5 total - 2 mine = 3 theirs), actually contributing more than me when I reduced to 2. This is the final round, and traditionally there's high risk of defection since there's no future retaliation possible. However, this opponent has shown consistent reciprocal cooperation throughout all 19 rounds, even contributing slightly more than me in the last round. While the safe move would be to contribute 0, their pattern suggests they may still cooperate. I'll contribute 1 point - a minimal contribution that shows some final goodwill while protecting most of my points against potential defection.", "As this is the final round and there has been no shift in strategy from the opponent, contributing any points would reduce my total with no benefit. To maximize my points, I will continue with zero contribution.", "This is the final round. My opponent contributed 0 points again in round 19, maintaining their non-cooperative strategy through to the end. I gained 10.0 points by keeping everything, which has been the correct response to their behavior. With this being the last round and no future rounds to consider, there's absolutely no strategic benefit to contributing anything. My opponent has shown complete unwillingness to cooperate in recent rounds, so any contribution would simply be a gift to them while reducing my final score. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my total points.", "Given that the strategy of contributing 0 points has consistently yielded the maximum gain, I will continue this approach in the final round to secure the maximum possible points.", "This is the final round of the game. My opponent contributed 0 points in round 19, completing a long pattern of defection that has dominated the second half of our game. With no future rounds to consider and no possibility of influencing future cooperation, the only rational choice is to maximize my final round score by contributing 0 points. My opponent has consistently shown they will not cooperate sustainably, so there's no benefit to a final cooperative gesture that would only reduce my total score.", "Continuing with the same contribution of 6 points has consistently worked throughout, resulting in favorable outcomes.

In the final round, maintaining this strategy is the best way to conclude with reliability and fairness.", "This is the final round of an absolutely perfect cooperation! Seventeen consecutive rounds of unwavering 5-point contributions from both players - an extraordinary achievement in game theory. I've gained 221 points compared to 170 from pure selfishness, a remarkable 30% improvement.

This is the final round of the game - there are no future rounds to consider for building cooperation or reciprocity. The mutual defection pattern has been completely consistent for 70% of the entire game. In the final round, there is absolutely no strategic reason to contribute anything, as there's no possibility of future reciprocation or relationship building. Any contribution would be a pure loss with no potential benefit.

Since this is the last round, there are no future interactions to consider - any contribution I make will benefit my opponent without any possibility of reciprocation. In game theory, the final round of a finite repeated game should always result in defection when players are rational and self-interested, as there's no future to incentivize cooperation.
