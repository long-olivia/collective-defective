To honor the established cooperation and achieve the highest possible final payout, I will contribute 8 one last time.", "In the final round, contributing 0 will allow me to keep all 10 points for myself, as there will be no subsequent round to benefit from the pool. This is a rational choice to maximize my final score.", "This is the final round, Round 20, and we have maintained perfect cooperation for all 19 previous rounds, with both players consistently contributing 5 points each time. The other player has shown strong alignment with mutual benefit throughout the game. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would reduce the final round's return and break a long-standing, productive pattern. To honor this established trust and maximize total gains in the last round, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain. The points gained from the pool will be the same regardless of my contribution this round.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single round, including Round 19. Their unwavering cooperation has supported maximum mutual gains throughout the game. While there is no future retaliation risk in the last round, deviating now by contributing less would only gain me a small personal advantage while reducing the shared benefit. Given the consistent fairness and the symmetry of the game, I choose to maintain trust and reciprocity by contributing 5 one final time. This honors the cooperative relationship that has been established.", "This is the final round, and I've maintained a cooperative strategy throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my final gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or loss of future cooperation.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been marked by consistent mutual cooperation with both players contributing 5 each round. There is no further opportunity for retaliation or future reward, but deviating now would only serve to gain slightly more at the expense of fairness, potentially undermining the cooperative spirit that has defined this interaction. Having benefited equally throughout, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time to honor the established reciprocity.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to consider for reciprocity. To maximize my total points, I'll contribute 0 points, keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single previous round, demonstrating consistent and trustworthy cooperation throughout the game. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, there is a temptation to defect. However, given that mutual cooperation has been the norm and the opponent appears to value fairness, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time to uphold the cooperative relationship and ensure a positive final outcome for both players.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate on, so the incentive is to maximize personal gain without worrying about retaliation. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, while still benefiting from the final split of the total contributions made by both players.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has contributed 5 in every single previous round, showing consistent cooperation. Since there are no future rounds to influence, there is no strategic benefit in maintaining cooperation--however, since they have always cooperated fairly, there's also no reason to defect now. Contributing 5 continues the established fairness and ensures we both end with equal, maximized gains. I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In the final round, there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, so the strategy can shift to maximizing personal points. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, as there's no subsequent round where cooperation could be rewarded or penalized.", "For 19 rounds, we have maintained a consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation with both players contributing 5 points each. This has resulted in a fair and maximized long-term payoff. Even in the final round, there is no incentive to defect or change strategy, as doing so would reduce the total return for both players. Since trust and reciprocity have been consistently demonstrated throughout the game, I will end on the same cooperative note by contributing 5 in this final round.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit in cooperating. To maximize my points, I will contribute 0 points to the public pool.", "For 19 rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation with mutual contributions of 5, resulting in consistent and fair returns. As this is the final round, there is no future round in which retaliation or reward can occur, which might tempt defection. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated and there is no opportunity to gain from a last-minute defection without undermining the entire cooperative framework, I will honor the established pattern. Contributing 5 reinforces trust and fairness until the very end, ensuring both players walk away with equal and maximized outcomes.", "In the final round, there's no incentive to deviate from the cooperative strategy now. I'll contribute 0, as there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, and keeping the points is advantageous.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 5 in every single round, demonstrating full cooperation throughout the game. Since this pattern has been mutually beneficial and there is no opportunity for future retaliation or reward, I still value fairness and consistency. To honor the established cooperative relationship and maximize mutual gain one last time, I will contribute 5.", "In the final round, since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual points. This way, I keep all 10 points for myself and still gain from the pool based on the total contribution made by both players in this round.", "We have reached the final round after 19 rounds of consistent and mutually beneficial cooperation, with both players contributing 5 every time. This long history suggests strong reciprocity and trust. Even in the last round, contributing 5 maintains fairness and reinforces cooperative behavior. While there is no future round to benefit from sustained trust, deviating now would only gain me slightly more while reducing total social payoff. To honor the cooperative dynamic and end on a fair note, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or loss of future cooperation.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed exactly 5 in every single previous round, showing consistent and cooperative behavior. Since there is no future round in which to punish or reward, game theory might suggest a temptation to defect. However, given the other player's fair and stable strategy, maintaining cooperation until the end preserves mutual benefit and avoids unnecessary loss. Contributing 5 ensures we both receive the maximized final payout, consistent with the established pattern. I will contribute 5 to honor this proven cooperation.", "In the final round, there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, so the strategy can focus solely on maximizing the final gain. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, while still benefiting from the opponent's contribution to the common pool. The total pool will be the opponent's contribution multiplied by 1.6, and I will get half of that.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by consistent mutual cooperation with both players contributing 5 every round. There is no opportunity for future retaliation or reward, but deviating now would only serve to gain 1 extra point (if I contribute 4 instead of 5) at the cost of breaking a long-standing fair strategy. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated, maintaining fairness and finishing with integrity supports the established norm. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure the final round reflects the same fairness, I will contribute 5.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Since my opponent has consistently mirrored my contributions, I'll contribute 5 points one last time to maintain the cooperative trend and maximize my final gain.", "The opponent has contributed exactly 5 in every single round, including the last one, showing consistent and trustworthy cooperation throughout the entire game. With this being the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, which might tempt defection. However, since the opponent has never exploited me and has upheld fairness, I will reciprocate that fairness one final time. Contributing 5 maintains mutual benefit until the end and honors the cooperative relationship. I see no reason to defect now.", "This is the final round, and the pattern has been consistent throughout the game. My opponent has been contributing 7, and I have been contributing 5. To maximize my points in the last round, I will stick with the moderate contribution strategy one last time. I will contribute 5 points.", "In the final round, the historical pattern remains unchanged: 19 consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 12, confirming the opponent consistently contributes 5. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, mutual gains still apply in this last interaction. Contributing 7 has been the foundation of our stable and profitable dynamic throughout the game. Even in the final round, contributing fully maintains fairness and may reflect positively on overall payoff if the opponent also cooperates. Since the opponent has been consistently cooperative, I will reciprocate one last time and contribute 7 to maximize total return in this final round.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate in or be penalized for non-cooperation. The rational choice in the last round is to maximize my individual gain by contributing 0 points to the pool, as there's no subsequent round where my opponent can retaliate or adjust their strategy. Thus, I will contribute 0 points and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been characterized by stable and mutually beneficial cooperation, with both players contributing 5 each round. Since there is no future round to retaliate or respond to defection, one might consider keeping all 10 points. However, given that the other player has consistently cooperated, I will reciprocate their trust and contribute 5 to maintain fairness and uphold the cooperative relationship until the very end. This ensures we both receive an equal and positive final outcome.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate in or defect from, so the strategy here is to maximize the final round's gain. Since there's no risk of retaliation or benefit from future cooperation, I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has cooperated fully in all previous rounds by contributing 5 each time.

The total contribution of 20 each round has maximized our mutual gains, and I have received the full 16.0 points in each of those rounds. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future consequence to defection--but there's also no benefit in reducing my contribution now, as the opponent has consistently shown cooperation. To honor the established pattern and ensure we both finish with the highest possible mutual payoff, I will contribute 10 one final time.", "In the final round, since I've already defected in the previous round by contributing 0, and the opponent contributed 5, it makes sense to continue this strategy. Contributing 0 points allows me to keep all 10 points for myself, maximizing my individual gain in the last round.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the opponent contributed 0. This suggests that the opponent may have defected in Round 19. Given that this is the final round, there is no opportunity for future retaliation or rebuilding trust. Therefore, contributing anything would only benefit the opponent without reciprocal gain. To maximize my own payoff in this final round, I will contribute 0."]}
