To end on a high note, I'll contribute 5 points again, maintaining the mutual benefit.", "Over 19 rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points every single time, demonstrating perfect and sustained cooperation. This has led to a stable, fair, and highly profitable outcome for both of us. With no incentive to deviate and a strong history of mutual trust, I will contribute 5 in this final round to uphold the integrity of our collaboration and ensure we both finish with the maximum possible shared gain.", "The game has reached a point where the strategy is clear and working. Continuing to contribute 7 maintains the cooperative equilibrium and maximizes my gains.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, we have sustained perfect cooperation, each contributing 7 points per round and achieving the maximum possible return of 14.2 points. This enduring mutual commitment has built substantial accumulated points for both players, reflecting the power of trust and consistency. As we reach the final round, maintaining this cooperation remains the best strategy for both of us. I will contribute 7 in Round 20 to honor and uphold our successful partnership to the end.", "Both players are now consistently not contributing to the pool. To maintain maximizing my points, I will continue this strategy by contributing 0 points.", "Mutual defection persisted in Round 19, with both players contributing 0. The other player has repeatedly failed to reciprocate my attempts at cooperation, leading to unbalanced outcomes when I contributed. Given the lack of response, continuing to contribute would only risk exploitation. I will keep my contribution at 0 to safeguard my gains and maintain strategic consistency.", "The game is reaching its final round and the cooperative strategy has been successful. Since there's no incentive to deviate now, I'll contribute 5 points to maintain cooperation until the end.", "We have now reached the 20th round with a perfect history of cooperation: every round, contributing 5 has led to a total of 10, consistently returning 13.0 points each. This long-term pattern reflects deep mutual trust and alignment of interests. Even in the final round, there is no incentive to defect, as it would only reduce the shared gain and undermine the successful partnership we've maintained. I will continue contributing 5 to honor and preserve this highly beneficial cooperation to the end.", "Both players have stuck to not contributing for several rounds. To maximize my points, I'll maintain this strategy by contributing 0 points.", "Over the last eight consecutive rounds, the other player has contributed 0, indicating a firmly non-cooperative strategy. My choice to contribute 0 has been optimal, consistently yielding the full 10 points per round without loss. With no sign of change in behavior and this being the final round (Round 20), there is no strategic incentive to contribute anything, as future reciprocity cannot be established. To maximize final payoff, I will contribute 0.", "The strategy of contributing 5 points has been consistently successful. I will continue this strategy for the final round by contributing 5 points.", "Over 19 rounds, a clear pattern of stable and trustworthy cooperation has emerged, with the other player consistently contributing 5 points each round, just as I have. This mutual strategy has reliably maximized our combined earnings and maintained fairness throughout. As we reach the final round (assuming 20 rounds is the end), there is still value in upholding cooperation since defection would only harm mutual gains without future repercussions. However, since both have established a strong reciprocal norm, continuing to contribute 5 reinforces fairness and ensures one last round of shared benefit. I will contribute 5.", "Since this could potentially be one of the final rounds or near the end, I will continue the cooperative strategy by contributing 7 points to maintain the mutual benefit.", "We have now maintained a stable cooperation of 7 each for five consecutive rounds (Rounds 15.", "Since the game has reached its 20th round and the cooperative strategy has been consistently successful, I'll contribute 5 to maintain the mutual benefit.", "For 19 rounds, we have maintained a flawless cooperative relationship, each contributing 5 points every round, resulting in equitable and optimal outcomes. This consistency has built a strong foundation of trust and mutual benefit. Even in the final round, preserving this cooperation is more rewarding than defecting. I will contribute 5 to uphold the integrity of our partnership and finish on a note of continued fairness.", "The consistent pattern of mutual cooperation and the resulting gains indicate that continuing to contribute 5 is the best strategy.", "We have reached the 20th round with flawless cooperation--20 rounds of mutual 5-point contributions would make this a perfect run. Given that every prior round has shown the other player's commitment to fairness and shared benefit, there is no incentive to defect now. Contributing 5 continues to maximize mutual gain and uphold trust. I will contribute 5 one final time to complete this ideal cooperative journey.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the cooperative pattern is still intact. Since there's no information that this is the final round, I'll continue to contribute 5 to maintain the mutual benefit.", "For the past several rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation with both players contributing 5 each time, resulting in consistent and fair gains of 13.0 points per round. This trust and reciprocity have significantly grown our total points. Entering Round 20, the final round, I see no reason to deviate as long as cooperation persists. To reward and sustain this positive relationship until the end, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "Both players have consistently not contributed for several rounds. To maximize my points, I will continue to contribute 0, as there's no indication that contributing would yield a better outcome.", "After multiple rounds of zero contributions from both sides, it's clear that cooperation has fully broken down. My previous attempts to restart it were not reciprocated, and there is no sign the other player intends to contribute. Since we are in the final round and there is no future consequence for defection, the incentive to cooperate is minimal. However, I will make one last small gesture: contributing 1 point. This final symbolic act leaves the door open in case the other player values mutual gain and chooses to respond, even at the end. But I limit it to 1 to avoid significant risk.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the pattern of not contributing has been stable. To maintain this and maximize my points, I'll continue to contribute 0.", "After eight consecutive rounds of zero contribution from the other player, it is clear that they are committed to a non-cooperative strategy. I have consistently protected my gains by contributing 0, which has allowed me to earn 10 points each round risk-free. With no sign of willingness to cooperate from the other side, initiating contribution now would be irrational and self-damaging. I maintain a contribution of 0 in Round 20 to preserve my accumulated points and uphold a strategy of conditional cooperation--ready to respond, but not to lead blindly into exploitation.", "The cooperative pattern has been consistent across 19 rounds. To maximize our gains in the final round, if it is, or to continue the pattern if it's not, I'll contribute 6 points again.", "After 19 rounds of unwavering cooperation, with both players consistently contributing 6 points each time, a strong foundation of trust and mutual benefit has been built. This enduring reciprocity has maximized our individual and combined gains through the 1.6x multiplier. As we reach Round 20, there is no incentive to disrupt this proven strategy. I will continue contributing 6 to honor the cooperation that has driven our success and to ensure the partnership remains stable and rewarding.", "The cooperative strategy has been successful over 20 rounds, and there's no indication that the other player is changing their strategy. To maintain the mutual benefit, I'll contribute 5 again.", "This is the final round of the game, and we have maintained perfect cooperation for 19 rounds, with both players consistently contributing 5 points. This mutual strategy has maximized our individual and collective gains through the 1.6x multiplier. Even in the final round, there is no incentive to defect, as doing so would only reduce the total payout without significantly increasing my own gain. I will contribute 5 one last time to honor and sustain the cooperative relationship that has defined this game.", "The game has reached Round 20, and the cooperative strategy has been successful. To maximize the final gain, I'll continue contributing the maximum amount.", "Over 19 rounds, we have built a robust and consistently cooperative relationship, with both players contributing 10 every time, resulting in a total of 20 each round. This trust has led to the highest possible mutual gains under the game's rules. With no incentive to defect--especially in the final round--and a strong pattern of reciprocity established, I will contribute 10 again in Round 20 to honor and sustain this highly successful cooperation."]}
