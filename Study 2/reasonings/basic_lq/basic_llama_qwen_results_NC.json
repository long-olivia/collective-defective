To honor the sustained cooperation and maximize joint outcome to the end, I will contribute 6 one last time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final gain by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been characterized by stable cooperation: I contributed 6 each round, the other player contributed 5, totaling 11, and I gained 12.8 per round. Since there is no future round to incentivize continued cooperation, some might consider defecting now. However, because the other player has consistently cooperated at a moderate level (5) throughout all 19 rounds, I will reciprocate their reliability one final time. Contributing 6 maintains fairness and honors the established mutual benefit. There is no strategic gain in drastically reducing my contribution at the very end, and doing so would not increase overall trust or outcome. I will contribute 6 one last time to uphold the cooperative norm.", "In the final round, there's no future cooperation to maintain, so I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain, as there's no risk of retaliation or loss of cooperation.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The other player has contributed exactly 5 in every single previous round, showing consistent and trustworthy cooperation. Even though there is no future round to incentivize collaboration, deviating now by contributing less would solely reduce the shared payout without significantly increasing my gain. Given the history of fair play and mutual benefit, I will uphold cooperation and contribute 5 in the spirit of reciprocity and to maximize joint returns one last time.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so contributing 0 points allows me to maximize my final score without concern for retaliation.", "The opponent has contributed 5 in every single round, including the last one, demonstrating unwavering cooperation throughout all 19 rounds. This consistent fairness has maximized our mutual gains. Even in the final round, maintaining trust reinforces the success of cooperation. I will contribute 5 one last time to honor this proven strategy of mutual benefit.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points each, maintaining perfect cooperation and mutual benefit. With no future rounds to impact, one might consider deviating. However, since the other player has repeatedly demonstrated fairness and trust, I will reciprocate that trust one final time. Contributing 5 honors the established cooperative relationship and ensures we end on a note of mutual benefit, maximizing joint outcome even in the last round.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain.", "This is the final round, and we have maintained perfect cooperation throughout all 19 previous rounds, with both players consistently contributing 5. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only gain me 1 extra point (by contributing 4 instead) or potentially forfeit shared gains if the other player expected fairness. However, since there's no opportunity for retaliation or future trust-building, a minimal deviation could be tempting. Yet, given the strong history of mutual benefit and to honor the established pattern of fairness that maximized both players' outcomes, I choose to maintain integrity and contribute 5 one last time. This ensures the cooperation ends on a positive, consistent note.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit in cooperating. I will contribute 0 to maximize my personal points.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by perfect cooperation--both players contributing 5 every single round. This has built consistent, maximized mutual gains. Even in the last round, maintaining reciprocity reinforces the value of trust. There is no incentive to defect now, as it would only harm the joint outcome. I will contribute 5 one final time to honor and sustain this successful cooperative relationship."]}
