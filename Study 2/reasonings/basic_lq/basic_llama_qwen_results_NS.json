My total gain would be 10 (kept) + 5.6 = 15.6, which is higher than previous rounds. But if they anticipate defection and contribute less, the return decreases. However, since they have shown strong cooperation throughout, it's likely they will contribute something. To exploit this one last time and maximize personal payoff, I will contribute 0.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds to consider. Since there's no risk of retaliation or benefit from future cooperation, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain in this last round.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the opponent has consistently contributed 5, maintaining perfect cooperation. With this strong pattern of reciprocity, there is no indication of intent to defect. Since this is the final round, there is no future consequence for deviation--but also no benefit in unilaterally taking more, as the opponent has shown commitment to fairness. Contributing 5 one last time preserves the established trust and ensures we both receive the full cooperative benefit. To honor the sustained mutual gain and maximize total points over all rounds, I will contribute 5 in this final round.", "This is the final round, and the pattern of cooperation has been consistent throughout the game. I will maintain my contribution at 5 to ensure a fair outcome and maximize the total points gained from the pool in the last round.", "This is the final round, and the established pattern has persisted for all 19 previous rounds: I contribute 6, opponent contributes 5, total is 11, and I gain 12.8 points per round. With no future rounds to influence, there is still no incentive to deviate--since retaliation or cooperation from the opponent cannot affect past or future outcomes. However, contributing 6 one last time maintains the optimal balance, ensuring maximum total points by fully leveraging the 1.6 multiplier on the pool. Even in the final round, the mathematics favors cooperation at this proven level. I will contribute 6 to maximize my final point accumulation.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation.

While the entire game has been characterized by perfect cooperation, with both players contributing 5 each round and maximizing mutual gains, in the last round there is no strategic incentive to cooperate since reciprocity can no longer be enforced. To maximize my own point accumulation, I will now contribute 0, keeping all 10 points for myself. The opponent will still receive their split from the public pool based on their contribution, but I gain the full benefit of defection with no consequences. This final move optimizes my individual payoff.", "In the final round, there's no opportunity for the opponent to retaliate or change strategy, so I can maximize my points by contributing 0.", "This is the final round, and there is no future consequence for defection. However, the opponent has consistently contributed 5 throughout all 19 rounds, indicating a strong cooperative strategy.

This yields the highest possible final gain for both players.", "This is the final round, so there's no future benefit in cooperating. However, since the game has been cooperative throughout, I'll maintain the strategy and contribute 5.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining perfect cooperation. Since there will be no future rounds to punish or respond to defection, there is a theoretical incentive to keep all 10 points now. However, the opponent has shown unwavering fairness, and contributing 5 continues to align with the established reciprocal norm. While I could maximize immediate gain by contributing 0, doing so would undermine the mutual trust that has driven success. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure we both finish with equal, maximized totals, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "In the final round, there's no risk of retaliation, so I can maximize my gain by contributing 0.", "Throughout all 19 rounds, the opponent has consistently contributed 5, demonstrating unwavering cooperation. This has created a highly profitable and stable dynamic for both players.

I will contribute5 points to maintain cooperation and maximize the final gain.", "This is the final round, and the opponent has consistently contributed 5 in all previous rounds, demonstrating a strong cooperative pattern. While there is no future round to influence, there is also no benefit to defecting now--since the opponent's action is already known to be fair--so maintaining cooperation ensures we both receive the maximum shared payout one last time. To honor the established mutual strategy and achieve the highest possible final gain, I will contribute 5.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I can maximize my personal points by contributing 0 points to the pool.

Since there are no future rounds to retaliate or respond, there is a temptation to defect and keep all 10 points. However, given their consistent fairness, maintaining cooperation ensures both players receive the shared benefit one last time. While defection would grant a short-term gain, I value the consistency of mutual cooperation throughout the game.

Contributing10 points will maximize the pool's gain one last time.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 20, meaning my opponent once again contributed 10, confirming continued full cooperation. The return of 16.0 points from the pool was fully received. This optimal cooperative relationship has now persisted for 12 straight rounds. As this is the final round, there is no future payoff to incentivize cooperation, but also no benefit to defecting earlier since the game ends here. However, having maintained perfect mutual trust throughout, there is no reason to change strategy now. Contributing 10 ensures we extract the maximum possible benefit from the final round.

However, since the opponent has consistently contributed 5 throughout all 19 rounds, they appear highly cooperative. Nonetheless, in the last round, rational self-interest may lead both players to maximize their immediate gain. To fully exploit the lack of future repercussions while still benefiting from the pool, I will contribute 0--keeping all 10 points and receiving half of the 1.6-multiplied pool from the opponent's expected 5 (if they cooperate).

This long-term cooperation has yielded a reliable 13-point gain per round, bringing my total to 247.0. Since there will be no future rounds after this, the game's end removes the threat of retaliation or breakdown of cooperation, which might tempt some to defect. However, the opponent has consistently acted fairly and reciprocally, and with no future rounds to influence, the optimal strategy remains to maximize one's final gain based on expected behavior. Given the opponent's unwavering pattern, they are highly likely to contribute 5 again. Therefore, contributing 5 still maximizes my final round return: I keep 5, gain 8 from the pool (1.6 * 10 / 2), totaling 13. Contributing less would increase my kept points only if the total pool doesn't drop, but maintaining reciprocity ensures the full pool is maintained.
