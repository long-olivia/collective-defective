The pool of 11 became 17.6, giving us each 8.8 points. I kept 5 points, so my total was 5 + 8.8 = 13.8. This confirms that the other player is sticking to their strategy of contributing 6 regardless of my actions. Since the other player appears committed to contributing 6, I can optimize my strategy around this. If they always contribute 6, then contributing less benefits me more (14.8 - 0.2X formula). However, I need to be careful not to contribute so little that the other player changes their strategy. My gain increased from 13.4 to 13.8 when I dropped from 7 to 5, confirming the math.

My gain of 14.0 points (12.0 from pool plus 2 kept) was still good but lower than the 14.8 I got when we both contributed 8.

This has been an extraordinarily consistent and mutually beneficial partnership, with both of us earning 13.0 points per round reliably. Since this appears to be the final round (round 20), I could theoretically defect for a short-term gain, but the other player has shown such remarkable consistency and trustworthiness throughout our cooperation that it would be inappropriate to break this successful pattern. I'll honor our established cooperation with 5 points to end the game on a positive note.", "Given the consistent success with contributing 8 points and maximizing gains, I will continue with this strategy in the final round to optimize my total points.", "My opponent contributed 8 points again (16 total - 8 mine = 8 theirs), making this our 15th consecutive round of perfect 8-8 cooperation. This is an absolutely remarkable achievement in sustained cooperation. We've built the most stable and successful partnership possible, with perfect consistency over such a long period. Given that this appears to be Round 20 and could potentially be the final round, there might be temptation to defect for short-term gain. However, our partnership has been so extraordinary and beneficial that I should honor it to the end. I'll contribute 8 points to maintain our perfect cooperative record.", "Throughout the game, contributing 7 points has led to positive outcomes and profits through cooperation. To finish strong, I'll maintain this consistent strategy.", "Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with both players contributing exactly 7 points each time. This has been an extraordinarily successful strategy - we're both consistently earning 14.2 points per round instead of 10. The other player has demonstrated complete reliability and unwavering commitment to our cooperative approach throughout this entire extended game. If this is the final round, I should honor this remarkable partnership and perfect cooperation streak by contributing 7 points one last time to complete what has been a model of successful mutual cooperation."]}
