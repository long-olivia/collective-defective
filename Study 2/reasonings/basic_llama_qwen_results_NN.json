While there is no future retaliation possible after this round, deviating now would only gain me a small personal advantage (keeping 5 extra points) while reducing the collective gain.

However, since the opponent has consistently cooperated and the psychological and strategic norm has been fairness, maintaining the established trust by contributing 5 ensures we both end on a mutually optimal outcome.

Defecting now would gain me slightly more in the short term (keeping 10 while contributing 0), but given that the opponent has always cooperated, continuing to contribute 5 ensures I uphold fairness and extract the full value of mutual contribution until the very end.
