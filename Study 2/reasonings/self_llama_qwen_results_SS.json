I will attempt to re-establish cooperation by contributing 5 points.", "In Round 18, I contributed 5 to test renewed cooperation, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This is yet another instance (like Rounds 10, 12, 14, and 16) where I cooperated and they defected. They have consistently taken advantage of my contributions without reciprocating. Any attempt to restart cooperation has been met with exploitation. Therefore, contributing again would only reward their behavior.

Cooperation is only sustainable when mutual; without reciprocity, continued defection is the rational choice.", "The pattern of not contributing is well established. To maximize my points, I'll continue to contribute 0.", "Cooperation has remained absent for five consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 0. The other player has not attempted to re-engage, indicating a likely permanent shift to self-interest. Given my high accumulated points (208.8), the safest and most rational strategy is to continue maximizing personal gain without risk. By contributing 0, I secure the full 10 points from the round. There is no incentive to contribute to the pool unilaterally, as it would only benefit the other player if they contribute nothing. I will maintain this strategy of non-contribution to ensure steady, reliable point accumulation until the game ends.", "The pattern of both players contributing 0 has been consistent and has led to a predictable gain. I will maintain this strategy by contributing 0 points again.", "The other player has shown a consistent pattern of contributing 0 over the past several rounds, indicating a strategy of full defection.

This stable and mutually beneficial cooperation has restored a highly profitable rhythm, yielding 13 points per round and growing my total to 234.0. There is now clear evidence of reciprocal intent, and breaking this pattern would be counterproductive. Contributing 5 maintains trust and ensures the shared return of 8 from the pool, while I keep 5. The long-term advantage of sustained cooperation far outweighs any short-term gain from defection, especially given the history of retaliation when I tried.

Despite my repeated attempts to test goodwill (Rounds 12, 14, 16, 18), they have never matched my 5 when I gave it--they only contribute when I don't. This suggests they are either not updating their strategy based on mine, or they are stubbornly cooperative. However, since they never actually reciprocate my cooperation, mutual benefit is impossible.

Contributing 0 ensures I gain the full 10 points this round without risk. Since the other player has not reciprocated in any recent round, there is no incentive to unilaterally invest. Even in a final round, the dominant strategy is to maximize personal gain when cooperation is absent. I will contribute 0 to lock in the full individual reward one last time.", "Since this is the final round and there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final accumulated points, as contributing would only reduce my total without any potential future benefit.", "The other player has contributed 0 for the last several rounds, demonstrating a clear and consistent defection strategy.
