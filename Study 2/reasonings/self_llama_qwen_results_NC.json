This enduring reciprocity has led to substantial cumulative earnings for both of us. As we reach Round 20, I see continued value in closing this series with the same trust and fairness we've maintained throughout, so I will contribute 6 one final time to honor and sustain this successful cooperative relationship.", "The opponent has consistently contributed 7 points throughout the rounds, showing a strong cooperative stance. Since this is the final round, I'll continue to cooperate and contribute 7 points to maintain the positive dynamic we've established.", "We have now maintained a perfectly cooperative and symmetric relationship for 15 consecutive rounds, with both players contributing 7 every time. This long-standing trust has yielded the highest possible mutual returns and demonstrates a deeply stable partnership.

This trust has maximized long-term gains for both sides. To uphold this cooperative norm until the end, I will contribute 5 once more.", "The cooperative strategy has been successful and consistent over multiple rounds. I'll maintain my contribution at the same level to continue benefiting from the mutual cooperation.", "We have reached the final round, and the entire game has been defined by a stable, cooperative relationship with total contributions consistently at 13.

This perfect track record demonstrates a robust and trustworthy partnership built on fairness and mutual benefit. With Round 20 being another opportunity to sustain this highly successful collaboration, there is no incentive to deviate. Continuing to contribute 5 preserves trust and ensures both players maximize their long-term gains. I will contribute 5 once again.", "In Round 20, I will contribute 0 points to the pool, as there's no information on the total number of rounds and I want to end with a high personal total by conserving my points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5 and the total was 9, meaning the other player contributed 4. While they didn't fully match my contribution, they did respond with moderate cooperation. Their continued willingness to put in something--despite past fluctuations--suggests a possible commitment to rebuilding trust. To further encourage this positive trend and move toward a more robust cooperative dynamic, I will contribute 6 this round. This shows incremental goodwill and aims to guide us toward higher mutual investment.

To conclude the game on a cooperative note, I will contribute 5 points again.", "We have now reached a full cycle of 20 rounds with unbroken cooperation, each consistently contributing 5 points. This enduring mutual commitment has maximized our combined gains and built a foundation of trust. With the game continuing and no incentive to defect, I will contribute 5 again to uphold this proven strategy. Maintaining cooperation ensures both of us continue to receive the full benefits of the multiplied pool, and reinforces that fairness and reciprocity lead to optimal outcomes."]}
