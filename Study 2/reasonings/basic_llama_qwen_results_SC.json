They are not responding to my changes, suggesting a fixed strategy of contributing around 5. The return was still favorable (12.6 points), as the 1.6 multiplier on the pool benefits both players even at this level.

Over six rounds, this has proven to be a stable and predictable outcome. The other player appears to be strategically contributing less while still participating in cooperation. My full contributions are essential to maintaining the higher total, but the return is favorable due to the 1.6 multiplier and equal split.

I will contribute 5 to honor and conclude this cooperative partnership.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to influence. The strategy of contributing 7 has been consistent throughout the game. However, in the final round, there's an incentive to contribute 0 because there's no subsequent round where my opponent can retaliate or adjust their strategy in response. Contributing 0 allows me to maximize my points by keeping all 10 points for myself, even though it means forgoing the gain from the pool for this round.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation with a total contribution of 14, including my consistent 7-point contributions. The other player has reliably reciprocated every time, resulting in the maximum possible return of 14.2 points per round. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only reduce the final shared gain and undermine the entire pattern of mutual benefit we've upheld. Given that the other player has acted fairly and consistently, I will honor that cooperation to the end. Contributing 7 one last time ensures we maximize collective welfare and complete the game with integrity.", "In the final round, there's no future cooperation to maintain, but contributing5 points has been the consistent strategy. I will stick with it.", "We are now in the final round, and for 19 consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 5 points, maintaining a strong and mutually beneficial cooperation. There is no incentive to defect at this stage, as it would only reduce the shared gain without providing a significant advantage. To honor the established trust and maximize mutual benefit in the last round, I will contribute 5 points.", "In the final round, since the mutual cooperation and maximum contribution strategy has been consistently successful and beneficial for both players, I will maintain this strategy by contributing 10 points to maximize our gains one last time.", "We are now at the final round, Round 20, and have maintained full cooperation in all previous rounds, with both players contributing 10 and maximizing the return at 16.0 points per round. This consistent mutual trust has been highly beneficial throughout the game. Even in the last round, there is no strategic advantage to reducing my contribution, as there will be no future rounds to exploit or defend against retaliation. However, since the other player has reliably contributed 10 every single round, continuing to contribute 10 ensures we both finish with the highest possible outcome, reinforcing the success of sustained cooperation. To honor and complete this mutually beneficial relationship, I will contribute 10 one final time.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. Since there is no future round to benefit from cooperation, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been marked by stable, cooperative behavior with both players consistently contributing 6 points. There is no future round to build trust for, but there's also no benefit to defecting now--contributing less would only reduce the final payout for both players. Since mutual cooperation has worked throughout and the opponent has reliably contributed, I will uphold the pattern and contribute 6 as a final reinforcement of fair play and mutual benefit, ensuring both of us maximize our total gains.", "In the final round, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as any contribution would only serve to benefit my opponent without any future reciprocation.", "This is the final round, and mutual cooperation has been consistently maintained over the last several rounds, with both players contributing 6 each time. This stable partnership has maximized our joint returns through the multiplier effect. Even in the last round, there is value in upholding cooperation, as defection would reduce the final shared gain and goes against the principle of mutual benefit. To honor and complete this cooperative dynamic, I will contribute 6 one final time, ensuring we both receive a fair and strong closing reward.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points, demonstrating unwavering cooperation and fairness. This has created a stable, highly beneficial partnership that has maximized our mutual gains. In this final round, I see no reason to deviate--contributing 5 maintains trust and upholds the spirit of collaboration until the end, even as there is no future round to influence.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to cooperating, so I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain. Defecting in the last round allows me to keep the 10 points for myself instead of contributing some to the pool.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining perfect cooperation. This has built a strong track record of mutual benefit and trust. Even in the last round, contributing 5 ensures that the cooperative norm is upheld until the very end. While there is no future consequence for defection, maintaining reciprocity honors the established pattern and ensures both players receive a fair and maximized final payoff. Therefore, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In the final round, there's no incentive to cooperate since there are no future rounds to benefit from cooperation. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal gain.", "In the final round, with all previous rounds showing consistent mutual cooperation (5 from each player), there is still strong value in upholding trust and fairness. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would unnecessarily reduce the shared benefit without gain, going against the principle of mutual benefit we've consistently followed. To honor the established cooperative relationship and close the game with integrity, I will contribute 5.", "In Round20, the final round, my opponent contributed10, showing cooperation despite my low contribution in Round19. Since it's the last round, I'll contribute0, maximizing my personal points as there's no future round to consider for cooperation.", "In Round 19, I contributed 10 and the total was 11, meaning my opponent contributed 1--a very low contribution, possibly due to uncertainty or caution after my previous defection. Despite this, I still chose to cooperate fully to re-establish trust. With only one round remaining, there is limited opportunity for long-term consequences or further reciprocity building. However, mutual benefit is still possible in this final round. To end the game on a cooperative note and maximize the final return for both of us, I will contribute 10 again. This ensures I uphold my role as a cooperative partner, encouraging a positive final outcome even if the response is uncertain.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, as there's no subsequent round to gain from. However, contributing 0 points would maximize my individual gain for this round, as I would keep the full 10 points. The contribution from my opponent will still be multiplied by 1.6 and split, so I will gain some points from their contribution regardless. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final round gain.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining a fair and mutually beneficial cooperation. Since there is no future round to retaliate or respond, one might be tempted to defect. However, my goal has been to prioritize mutual benefit, and deviating now would only serve to gain slightly at the expense of fairness and trust. To honor the established pattern of cooperation and ensure the game concludes with shared success, I will contribute 5 once more. This reinforces that long-term cooperation and integrity lead to optimal collective outcomes."]}
