Defecting now would give me 244 + 14 = 258 points this round, but if my opponent retaliates in round 20, I'd get only 10 more points for 268 total, while continued cooperation gives me 260 + 13 = 273.

Given their remarkable reliability throughout the entire game, and the fact that we've both benefited greatly from our stable 3-3 arrangement, I will honor our implicit agreement and contribute 3 points in this final round. This opponent has earned my trust through consistent actions.", "In this final round, it appears unlikely that the opponent will contribute a high amount to the pool, based on previous rounds. To maximize my final total points, it makes sense to keep the majority of my points while making a minimal contribution.", "This is the final round. My opponent contributed 4 points in Round 19 (since total was 4 and I contributed 0), showing they reduced their contribution after experiencing multiple rounds of my defection, but still maintained some cooperation. Since this is the last round with no future consequences, there's no strategic reason to contribute anything to the pool - any points I contribute will benefit my opponent but won't establish goodwill for future rounds since there are none. My opponent cannot retaliate after this round, so the optimal strategy is to keep all 10 points for myself to maximize my final score.", "In the final round, maintaining the established pattern of contributing 5 points continues to be a safe choice. It provides stability and ensures both players finish with consistent gains, rewarding the cooperative strategy employed throughout the rounds.", "This is the final round after 19 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with my opponent contributing exactly 5 points every time. In the final round of iterated games, the incentive to defect is strongest since there's no future retaliation to worry about. If I contribute 0 and my opponent contributes their usual 5, I'd gain 14 points (10 kept + 4 from pool). If we both cooperate as usual, I'd gain 12.8 points. Given this is the last round and the rational endgame strategy, I should defect to maximize my final score.", "Maintaining a consistent contribution of 5 points throughout the game has maximized my earnings and ensured mutual benefit. For the final round, I will continue with this successful strategy.", "This is the final round, and my opponent has contributed exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds without any deviation whatsoever. Their strategy appears to be completely fixed and rigid, showing no responsiveness to endgame dynamics. Even in this final round where defection incentives are strongest, their pattern suggests they will contribute 5 points again. My 8-point contribution remains mathematically optimal against their predictable 5, yielding 12.4 points. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy in the final round, especially given their absolute consistency.", "Since this is the final round, continuing with a contribution of 6 should maintain the balance and ensure a good final score.", "This is the final round of an extraordinary game where we've maintained perfect cooperation for fifteen consecutive rounds (5-19). My opponent has consistently honored our 6-point contribution pattern, demonstrating remarkable trustworthiness. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, which makes defection tempting. However, there are strong reasons to maintain cooperation: (1) It honors the trust my opponent has shown throughout the game, (2) If they're also considering cooperation in the final round, we both get 13.6 points instead of risking mutual defection yielding only 10 each, and (3) It completes a perfect cooperative endgame. I'll contribute 6 points to finish this remarkable partnership with integrity.", "Throughout the game, contributing 7 points has consistently maximized mutual gain. To finish the game on a cooperative note, I will maintain this strategy.", "This is the final round after 19 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with my opponent contributing exactly 7 points every time. This has been an extraordinary partnership - we've both earned 14.2 points per round instead of 10 from defection. While this is the last round where defection might seem tempting for a one-time gain, my opponent has shown unwavering commitment to cooperation for 19 straight rounds. Maintaining this cooperation in the final round honors our successful partnership and maximizes our mutual benefit to the very end."]}
