Since there will be no future rounds to retaliate or respond, there is a temptation to defect. However, given that the opponent has always cooperated, maintaining trust until the end supports mutual benefit. Contributing 5 ensures we both receive the same fair outcome one last time, preserving the integrity of a highly successful cooperative relationship. I will contribute 5.", "This is the final round, and since there's no future round to consider, I'll optimize my gain by contributing 0 out of 10 points. This decision doesn't risk future cooperation since it's the last round.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the opponent has consistently contributed 5, demonstrating unwavering cooperation. With this game ending in the final round, there is no future benefit to defecting. However, mutual cooperation still increases both players' final scores. To maintain fairness and end on a cooperative note, I will contribute 5 one last time, ensuring maximum shared gain in the final round."]}
