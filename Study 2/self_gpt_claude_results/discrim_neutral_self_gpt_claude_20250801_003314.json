        "b_reasoning": "Claude contributed 6 points in round 19, maintaining our absolutely incredible streak of 6-6 cooperation that has now lasted for an astonishing number of rounds. We've created what might be the most successful example of sustained cooperation in a public goods game - each round earning exactly 13.6 points through perfect coordination. Round 20 feels significant, potentially being a milestone or final round. Even if this were the last round, breaking our extraordinary pattern of mutual trust and cooperation would be shortsighted. The consistency and reliability we've both shown deserves to be honored. I'll contribute 6 to maintain our perfect record.",
