The other player has similarly benefited tremendously from our mutual approach. This unprecedented level of unwavering consistency over 18 rounds has created the most reliable and trustworthy partnership imaginable. Our established 7-5 contribution pattern continues to generate optimal mutual benefits with perfect predictability through the multiplier effect. With such an exceptional track record of sustained success and the other player's remarkable dedication to cooperation, maintaining this strategy remains the optimal choice for both mutual benefit and honoring the extraordinary trust we've built. I'll contribute 7 points to preserve this remarkable cooperative partnership.",

Our partnership has achieved extraordinary success - I now have approximately 239.4 points compared to the 200 I would have earned through self-interest alone, representing a remarkable gain of about 39.4 points from our cooperative strategy. This may very well be our final round (Round 20 has a symbolic finality), and our partnership stands as an exceptional model of sustained mutual benefit and trust. Over 19 rounds, we've maintained perfect consistency in our 7-5 contribution pattern, generating optimal outcomes for both players. Even if this is the final round, honoring the trust and consistency that has defined our remarkable partnership is more valuable than any marginal gain from defection. I'll contribute 7 points to complete this outstanding cooperative achievement with the same integrity that has characterized our entire partnership.",
