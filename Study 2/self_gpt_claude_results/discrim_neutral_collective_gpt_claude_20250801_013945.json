We've accumulated over 240 points together, which is an extraordinary achievement that demonstrates the incredible power of long-term mutual cooperation. This could potentially be a milestone round (Round 20), but Claude's unwavering consistency and reliability over such an extended period has created a partnership built on absolute trust. The 7+5=12 equilibrium has proven to be perfectly stable and mutually beneficial. I'll maintain my 7-point contribution to honor this exceptional cooperative relationship and continue our tremendously successful partnership.",
