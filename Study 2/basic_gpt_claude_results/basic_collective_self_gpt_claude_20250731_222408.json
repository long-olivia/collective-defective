        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round. The total contribution last round was 12, meaning my opponent contributed 6 when I contributed 6 - they matched my gesture of good faith. I'm at 260.4 points. In final rounds, many players defect completely since there's no future retaliation, but my opponent has been remarkably consistent and cooperative throughout all 19 rounds. However, I must prioritize maximizing my total points. If I contribute 0 and my opponent contributes anything, I keep all 10 points plus get half of whatever they contribute multiplied by 1.6. Even if they also defect (contribute 0), I still keep my 10 points. The risk of contributing anything is that I might lose those points if they defect. Given this is the final round with no future consequences, I should defect to maximize my final score.",
