With only 1 round remaining after this one, I'm at the final critical decision. If I cooperate for both remaining rounds, I'll gain 2 \u00d7 13.6 = 27.2 points. If I defect now, I gain 10 + (6 \u00d7 1.6 / 2) = 14.8 this round, but likely face retaliation in round 20, getting only 10 points, totaling 24.8. Cooperation still yields slightly more (27.2 vs 24.8). My opponent has demonstrated extraordinary trustworthiness and deserves reciprocal loyalty. I'll maintain our partnership.",

This is the final round, so there's no future retaliation to consider. If I cooperate with 6 points, I'll gain 13.6 points total (4 kept + 9.6 from pool). If I defect with 0 points, I'll gain 10 kept + (6 \u00d7 1.6 / 2) = 14.8 points. Purely mathematically, defecting gives 1.2 more points.
