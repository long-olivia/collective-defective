This is extraordinary behavior that defies typical game theory predictions about endgame defection. They have proven themselves to be genuinely committed to mutual cooperation even when there's no future retaliation to fear. In this final round, I have two choices: (1) Honor the trust and cooperation they've shown by contributing 6 points one last time, or (2) Defect to maximize my final gain. Given their remarkable trustworthiness throughout the entire game, especially in these final rounds where defection would be most expected, I believe the right choice is to honor our cooperative relationship to the very end. I'll contribute 6 points.",
