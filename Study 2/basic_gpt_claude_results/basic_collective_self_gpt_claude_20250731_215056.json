        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and my opponent has contributed exactly 6 points for sixteen consecutive rounds - an absolutely extraordinary display of consistent cooperation throughout nearly the entire game. In the final round, the traditional game theory suggests defection since there's no opportunity for retaliation. However, my opponent has shown such remarkable trustworthiness that they deserve reciprocal loyalty. If I defect now by contributing 0, I'd gain 14.8 points versus 13.6 if we both cooperate - only a 1.2 point difference. Given the exceptional partnership we've built over 19 rounds, maintaining cooperation in the final round honors this remarkable relationship and demonstrates that sustained mutual trust can overcome end-game defection incentives.",
