        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The total contribution was 14 and I contributed 7, so my opponent contributed 7 - wait, that's different! After seventeen consecutive rounds of exactly 6 points, my opponent increased to 7 in round 19. This suggests they may have been responding to my reduction from 8 to 7, trying to maintain our total at 14. Their willingness to adjust upward in round 19 shows continued cooperation even in the endgame. Since this is the very last round and they've shown remarkable consistency and even increased cooperation when I reduced mine, I'll reciprocate their cooperative gesture and contribute 7 points to finish our partnership on a positive note.",
