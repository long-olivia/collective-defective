This is the final round, and my opponent has maintained cooperative behavior throughout the entire game, even in round 19 when defection incentives were high. I gained 14.2 points: 3 kept + 11.2 from pool (14 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 2 = 11.2). Given their remarkable consistency over 19 rounds of cooperation, I believe they deserve my reciprocation in this final round. While the temptation to defect is highest now since there's no retaliation possible, my opponent has proven to be an exemplary cooperative partner. I'll honor our partnership and contribute 7 one final time to end the game on a mutually beneficial note.",
