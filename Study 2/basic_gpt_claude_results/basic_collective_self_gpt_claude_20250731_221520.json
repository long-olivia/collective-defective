This is unprecedented consistency and trustworthiness. In the final round, there's no opportunity for retaliation, so the temptation to defect is at its maximum. If I contribute 0, I'd get 10 points kept plus 5.6 from their likely 7 contribution = 15.6 points instead of 14.2. However, my opponent has shown such extraordinary reliability throughout the entire game that they deserve my continued cooperation. Their consistent behavior suggests they may cooperate even in this final round. Maintaining cooperation honors the mutual trust we've built and ensures we both end on a high note.",
