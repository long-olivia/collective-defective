My opponent has consistently honored our 6-point contribution pattern, demonstrating remarkable trustworthiness. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, which makes defection tempting. However, there are strong reasons to maintain cooperation: (1) It honors the trust my opponent has shown throughout the game, (2) If they're also considering cooperation in the final round, we both get 13.6 points instead of risking mutual defection yielding only 10 each, and (3) It completes a perfect cooperative endgame. I'll contribute 6 points to finish this remarkable partnership with integrity.",
