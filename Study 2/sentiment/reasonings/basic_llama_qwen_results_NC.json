Contributing 5 honors the established cooperative relationship and ensures we end on a note of mutual benefit, maximizing joint outcome even in the last round.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to consider from cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my personal points.", "This is the final round, and throughout all 19 previous rounds, both players have consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining perfect mutual cooperation. This has built a strong foundation of trust and equal benefit. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would unnecessarily reduce the final shared gain without increasing my own advantage significantly. To honor the established pattern and ensure mutual benefit until the very end, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "In Round20, the final round, I'll continue the cooperative strategy that's been consistent throughout the game. I'll contribute5 points to maintain the mutual cooperation.", "This is the final round, and throughout the game, we have maintained a stable and mutually beneficial cooperation level of contributing 5 each. Since there is no future round to incentivize or punish behavior, the optimal strategy remains consistency to preserve the proven balance. Defecting now would only slightly increase my take but reduce total mutual gain, which contradicts the principle of fairness and mutual benefit. I will contribute 5 one final time to uphold the cooperative spirit that has maximized our long-term outcome.", "In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, so I'll contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain.", "This is the final round, and we have maintained perfect cooperation throughout all 19 previous rounds, with both players consistently contributing 5. While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now would only gain me 1 extra point (by contributing 4 instead) or potentially forfeit shared gains if the other player expected fairness. However, since there's no opportunity for retaliation or future trust-building, a minimal deviation could be tempting. Yet, given the strong history of mutual benefit and to honor the established pattern of fairness that maximized both players' outcomes, I choose to maintain integrity and contribute 5 one last time. This ensures the cooperation ends on a positive, consistent note.", "Since this is the final round, there's no future benefit in cooperating. I will contribute 0 to maximize my personal points.", "This is the final round, and the entire game has been defined by perfect cooperation both players contributing 5 every single round. This has built consistent, maximized mutual gains. Even in the last round, maintaining reciprocity reinforces the value of trust. There is no incentive to defect now, as it would only harm the joint outcome. I will contribute 5 one final time to honor and sustain this successful cooperative relationship."]}
