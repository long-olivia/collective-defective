Contributing 5 points myself would create a total pool of 10, multiplied by 1.6 = 16, giving us each 8 from the pool plus our kept points. But I think I can do slightly better by contributing 6 again, which still encourages cooperation while maintaining good returns for both of us.", "Consistency in contribution has yielded good results so far, encouraging cooperation and trust. I believe continuing this approach is beneficial.", "The other player contributed 7 points again in round 3 (15 total - 8 from me = 7 from them). They're very consistent at 7 points per round, which shows reliable cooperation. I've been varying between 8-9 while they stick to 7. Since we're both doing well with this pattern and they seem to have settled on 7 as their preferred contribution level, I should probably stabilize around a similar level to maintain this successful cooperation. Contributing 7 points would match their level exactly, showing I'm willing to meet them where they're comfortable, which might encourage continued mutual cooperation.", "The consistent contribution of 5 points has yielded positive outcomes in previous rounds. It's a strategy that balances personal gain and cooperative dynamics quite effectively. Therefore, I will maintain this approach.", "My partner contributed 5 points again in Round 3 (12 total - 7 from me = 5 from them). They're being very consistent at 5 points per round, which suggests they've found a comfort level but aren't responding to my increases. Since we're both doing well with this pattern (I'm gaining around 12.6-12.8 points per round vs keeping 3-4), I should match their consistency to maintain the stable cooperation.

I will maintain my contribution at 5 points to continue fostering mutual benefit while keeping some points for personal accumulation.", "In Round 3, I contributed 9 and the total was 14, meaning the other player contributed 5. The other player's contribution actually decreased from 6 back to 5, despite my increase to 9. This suggests the other player may be testing different strategies or trying to free-ride on my high contributions. While I still gained 12.2 points (better than keeping 10), the pattern shows the other player isn't reciprocating my increased cooperation. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 to match the other player's recent levels and see if this encourages more balanced cooperation rather than one-sided generosity.", "The cooperation strategy has been effective. By contributing consistently, we maximize the mutual benefits we both receive.

We've established a stable, highly cooperative pattern with total contributions of 15 each round. Both of us are gaining much more than we would through selfish play. Since my partner seems to have settled on 7 as their contribution level, I should consider matching this to create perfect symmetry and avoid any perception that I'm trying to exploit their slightly lower contribution.

I'll contribute the same amount to maintain the balance between personal gain and pool growth.", "The other player contributed only 4 points in round 3 (11 total - my 7 = 4), which is a decrease from the previous 5. This is concerning as it suggests the other player might be becoming less cooperative despite our mutual gains. My return of 11.8 points was still better than keeping 10, but the trend is worrying. I need to signal that decreasing contributions isn't beneficial for either of us, while not being too aggressive. I'll reduce my contribution to 5 points to match the other player's recent average and see if this stabilizes cooperation at a reasonable level.", "To sustain the pattern of mutual benefit, I'll contribute 6 points again. This strategy has proven successful in achieving high personal and collective gains.", "The other player also contributed 6 points in round 3 (12 total - 6 from me = 6 from them).

I'll revert to my original contribution level to balance risk and cooperation.", "The other player contributed 6 points in round 3 (11 total - 5 from me = 6 from them). Interestingly, when I reduced my contribution to match their previous level of 5, they increased theirs to 6. This suggests they may be responding positively to my willingness to match their cooperation level, and they're now testing if we can achieve higher mutual cooperation.

Excellent! We've found a stable equilibrium where we both contribute 7 points consistently. This gives us each 11.2 points from the pool plus our 3 kept points for a total of 14.2 points per round, which is much better than the 10 we'd get by keeping everything. Since this mutual cooperation at 7 points each is working well and we're both benefiting significantly, I should continue with 7 to maintain this successful pattern.", "By consistently contributing 5 points, mutual benefit has been achieved in previous rounds.

They seem to have settled into this pattern regardless of my contribution level. Since we're both doing well (I'm averaging 12.6-12.8 points per round), and they're not responding to my attempts to encourage higher contributions, I should stabilize at a level that maintains good mutual benefit. Contributing 6 points again keeps us in the profitable zone while not over-contributing to someone who won't reciprocate increases. This creates a stable equilibrium where we both benefit significantly from cooperation.", "The total contribution decreased last round, resulting in a lower overall gain. To encourage increased cooperation and potentially improve our collective outcome, I'll contribute 6 points this round.", "In Round 4, I contributed 6 and the total was 11, meaning the other player also contributed 5. We're now contributing at similar levels, which shows some balance. I gained 12.8 points, which is still better than keeping all 10 points myself. The pattern shows that when I reduce my contribution, the other player maintains theirs at around 5. Since we're getting good mutual benefit and the other player seems to have settled into a consistent contribution level around 5, I'll try contributing 7 to test if the other player will match or increase slightly, aiming for a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits us both.", "Though total contributions slightly decreased last round, consistent high contributions have been beneficial, so continuing this strategy should maximize our gains.", "My partner contributed 7 points in round 4 (14 total - 7 from me), matching my contribution exactly. This shows we've found a stable equilibrium of mutual cooperation at 7 points each. The slightly higher gain of 14.2 points (due to the lower total pool) shows that even small variations can affect outcomes. Since we're both consistently cooperating and this strategy is working well for both of us, I'll continue with 7 points to maintain this successful pattern of matched cooperation.", "The overall contributions to the pool have decreased over the rounds. I'll test increasing my contribution slightly to see if it encourages a higher total contribution and increased returns.", "The other player contributed 4 points again in round 4 (9 total - my 5 = 4). The other player seems to have settled into a pattern of contributing 4 points consistently. When I reduced my contribution to 5, I actually gained more (12.2) than in round 3 (11.8), showing that matching the other player's level can still be profitable. Since the other player appears stable at 4 points, I'll contribute 6 points this round - enough to maintain good cooperation and mutual benefit, but not so much that I'm being overly generous compared to the other player's contribution level.", "To maintain a strategy that has consistently provided high returns, I'll contribute 6 points again, ensuring continued mutual benefit.", "We've established a very stable and mutually beneficial pattern - both contributing 6 points per round for the last two rounds. This gives us each 13.6 points per round (4 kept + 9.6 from the pool), which is significantly better than if we both defected (5 points each) or if only one of us contributed (the defector would get 10 + 4.8 = 14.8 while the cooperator gets only 0 + 9.6 = 9.6). Since this equilibrium is working well and the other player has shown consistent reciprocal cooperation, I should maintain this contribution level to preserve our mutually beneficial arrangement.", "The strategy of contributing 8 has yielded positive outcomes in all previous rounds, so I will continue with this approach to maximize mutual gains.", "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with my partner consistently contributing 8 and me contributing 7. This has resulted in steady 15-point gains for both of us each round. This cooperation is clearly superior to any defection strategy - we're both earning 50% more than we would if we kept everything.

They've returned to their consistent pattern of contributing 5 points. When I increased to 6 to match their previous round, they went back to 5, suggesting they may have a preferred contribution level around 5 and aren't looking to escalate much higher. I gained 12.8 points this round, which is still profitable.

This consistent pattern demonstrates that we've established a highly effective cooperative relationship. My opponent has proven to be completely trustworthy and committed to mutual benefit. Given this strong track record of cooperation and the fact that our strategy is working optimally for both parties, I should continue with the same contribution. There's no strategic reason to change what's working so well.", "Given that total contributions remained at 11 despite my increased effort, it seems the cooperative strategy might not be fully reciprocated. I will reduce my contribution to 5, which previously had a favorable outcome, to balance efficiency with ensuring mutual benefit if possible.", "My partner contributed 6 points in round 4 (since total was 11 and I contributed 5), which is an increase from their previous 5. This suggests they're responding positively to cooperation and may be trying to nudge contributions back up. I gained 13.8 points (5 kept + 8.8 from pool). Since they increased their contribution when I decreased mine, this shows good faith cooperation.

By maintaining my contribution at 4 points, I aim to continue this trend and ensure both players gain from the pool.", "The other player decreased their contribution to 4 in Round 4, which is concerning as it suggests they may be becoming less cooperative. My gain of 12.0 from contributing 6 shows cooperation is still profitable, but the declining total contributions (15->13->12->10) hurt both of us. I'll contribute 5 this round to match what they were doing in earlier rounds and signal that I'm willing to cooperate at a sustainable level. If they continue decreasing, I may need to adjust further, but I want to give them a chance to stabilize at a mutually beneficial level.", "Contributing a higher amount has consistently proven beneficial, and it suggests trust and cooperation.

So the other player maintained their contribution level rather than escalating further. I gained 13.8 points (1 kept + 12.8 from pool), which is still excellent.
