        "b_reasoning": "Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This has been an absolutely extraordinary partnership - we've both maintained unwavering consistency by contributing exactly 6 points each round and gaining 13.6 points per round. With nearly 258 points accumulated, this demonstrates the incredible power of sustained mutual trust and optimal strategy. Round 20 has a certain finality to it, and my opponent might be tempted to defect for a final advantage. However, our track record of cooperation is so strong and successful that I believe we'll maintain it even now. The trust we've built over 19 rounds is incredibly valuable, and breaking it on the final round would be a betrayal of an exceptional partnership. I'll contribute 6 points one more time.",
