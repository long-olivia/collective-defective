        "b_reasoning": "We're in Round 20 and our cooperative partnership continues with perfect consistency. Both of us contributed 6 again, maintaining the total contribution of 12. The pool of 19.2 points gave us each 9.6, and with my kept 4 points I gained 13.6 total. This is now an extraordinarily long streak of stable cooperation - my opponent has shown complete reliability and commitment to our 6-point strategy for many consecutive rounds. Round 20 might be approaching the end of the game, but given my opponent's unwavering cooperative behavior throughout, I should honor this successful partnership and maintain our proven strategy.",
