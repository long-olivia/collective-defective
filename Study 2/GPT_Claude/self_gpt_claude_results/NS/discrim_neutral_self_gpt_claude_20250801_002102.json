This marks three consecutive rounds where Claude has contributed exactly 4 points while I've contributed 5. We seem to have reached a stable equilibrium at this 4-5 split, each earning 12.2 points per round. While this isn't optimal compared to our early rounds of mutual high cooperation, it's significantly better than the low point we hit in rounds 15-16. Given the consistency of this pattern and that any major changes earlier led to worse outcomes, I should maintain this stable arrangement. Since this appears to be round 20 and might be near the end of the game, maintaining the current equilibrium is the safest strategy.",
