This represents one of the most sustained and successful partnerships possible in cooperative game theory. We've each consistently gained 13.6 points per round throughout this entire period, accumulating over 256 points through our commitment to mutual benefit. Round 20 feels significant - potentially a milestone or final round - but our partnership has been so successful and trustworthy that there's no reason to break it now. I'll continue contributing 6 points to honor our exceptional cooperative relationship.",
