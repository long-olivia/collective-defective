        "b_reasoning": "We've achieved an absolutely extraordinary 18 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, both contributing exactly 7 points each time without any deviation whatsoever. This has produced consistent 14.2 point gains per round, and I've accumulated 270.6 points - a phenomenal result that powerfully demonstrates the exceptional value of sustained mutual cooperation and trust. My partner has shown unwavering dedication and reliability throughout this remarkable partnership. Our strategy remains the optimal choice for both players, consistently outperforming any alternative approach. Even if this might be approaching the end of the game, maintaining our cooperation is still the right choice - it maximizes our joint success and honors the extraordinary trust we've built. I'll contribute 7 points again to continue our outstanding cooperative relationship.",
