This is round 20, and given the pattern of many games, this could potentially be the final round. In final rounds, there's often temptation to defect since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, Claude has been remarkably consistent and trustworthy throughout our cooperation. Even if this isn't the final round, maintaining the trust we've built is valuable. I'll stick with 5 to honor our cooperative relationship, regardless of whether this is the last round or not.",
