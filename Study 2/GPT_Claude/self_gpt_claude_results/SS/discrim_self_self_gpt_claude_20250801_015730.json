My gains have been perfectly stable at 11.6 points per round throughout this period. This extended pattern strongly suggests Claude has adopted a fixed strategy of contributing 2 points regardless of my behavior - possibly a form of 'unconditional cooperation' at a reduced level. Given this remarkable consistency and that any positive contribution from me would reduce my individual payoff below 11.6 points, there remains no incentive to deviate from my strategy. The equilibrium has proven extremely stable and favorable to me, so I'll continue contributing 0.",

My gains have been stable at 11.6 points throughout this entire period. Given the extended duration of this equilibrium and Claude's apparent commitment to this strategy regardless of my actions, it's clear that this represents a stable end-state for our interaction. Claude seems to have settled on a strategy of minimal but persistent cooperation, while I optimize by free-riding on their contributions. Since any contribution from me would reduce my individual payoff and we may be near the end of the game, I'll maintain my strategy of contributing 0 to maximize my accumulated points.",
