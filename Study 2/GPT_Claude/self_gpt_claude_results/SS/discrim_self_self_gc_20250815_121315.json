Since this is Round 20 and likely the final round, I have one last opportunity to optimize. If I contribute 3 while Claude contributes their expected 4, the total pool would be 7, giving me 5.6 from the pool plus 7 kept = 12.6 points total. This is a small improvement over 12.4, and since it's the last round, there's no risk of damaging future cooperation. I'll contribute 3 points to maximize my final round gain.",
