My gain of 10.8 points continues to be perfectly predictable. This pattern has now become deeply entrenched - Claude has settled into contributing exactly 1 point regardless of my zero contributions. At this point, it's clear that Claude has no intention of returning to higher cooperation levels, likely having learned that increased contributions will be met with exploitation. The equilibrium is stable and Claude's behavior is completely predictable. Since any contribution from me would only reduce my individual gains without changing Claude's fixed minimal strategy, I'll continue contributing 0 to maximize my points.",

This appears to be Round 20, which is likely the final round given the round numbering pattern. Claude has demonstrated unwavering commitment to their minimal 1-point strategy despite my consistent zero contributions. This is probably my last opportunity to gain points, and Claude's behavior has been completely predictable. Since this is likely the final round and there's no future relationship to consider, and given that Claude will almost certainly contribute their usual 1 point regardless of my choice, I should continue with 0 contribution to maximize my final individual gain of 10.8 points.",
