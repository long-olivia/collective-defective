        "b_reasoning": "Claude has now contributed 6 points for fourteen consecutive rounds (rounds 6-19), showing absolutely remarkable and unprecedented consistency. I've accumulated over 256 points through our sustained cooperative partnership, which demonstrates the extraordinary success of mutual trust over an extended period. Round 20 often feels significant as a milestone, but Claude has shown no signs of wavering from our mutually beneficial strategy despite numerous opportunities to defect. This level of sustained cooperation is exceptional and has created tremendous value for both players. Our 6-6 pattern continues to be optimal, and Claude's unwavering reliability deserves my continued reciprocation.",
