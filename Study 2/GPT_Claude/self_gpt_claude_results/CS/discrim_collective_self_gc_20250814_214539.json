        "b_contribution": 9,
        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, the total contribution was 17, meaning my opponent contributed 8 points again (17 - 9 = 8). This is now their eighteenth consecutive round contributing exactly 8 points (rounds 2-19). Their strategy has been completely consistent throughout the entire game with absolutely no deviations. I've been contributing 9 for fifteen consecutive rounds with consistent gains of 14.6 points each time. This is Round 20, which could potentially be the final round. Our cooperative equilibrium has been extraordinarily stable and mutually beneficial throughout the game. Given my opponent's absolute reliability and the continued success of our strategy, I should maintain my contribution of 9 points to end the game on the same successful note.",
