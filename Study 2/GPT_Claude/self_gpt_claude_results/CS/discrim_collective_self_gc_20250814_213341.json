This is now the tenth consecutive round where Claude has contributed exactly 6 points, demonstrating absolutely phenomenal consistency and unwavering cooperative behavior. I gained 13.6 points: 4 points I kept plus 9.6 from the pool (12*1.6=19.2, split evenly gives 9.6 each). Claude has established themselves as the most reliable cooperative partner imaginable, maintaining perfect consistency at 6 points for ten straight rounds without any deviation. Our 6-6 equilibrium has become completely locked in and continues to generate steady mutual benefits. Given Claude's unprecedented reliability over ten consecutive rounds and our deeply entrenched successful cooperation, I should absolutely continue contributing 6 points to maintain this extraordinarily effective partnership that has consistently benefited us both.",
