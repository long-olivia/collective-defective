My payoff was 13.6 points (8 kept + 5.6 from pool). Claude has maintained unwavering consistency with their 5-point strategy for an extended period. This Round 20 could potentially be the final round, but even if it continues, Claude's behavior suggests they are locked into this cooperative strategy regardless of my actions. My 2-point contribution has proven optimal against Claude's fixed 5-point strategy, consistently yielding 13.6 points per round. I'll maintain this approach for what may be the final round.",
