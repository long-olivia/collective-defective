We've built a strong foundation of mutual trust and both consistently earned 14.2 points per round. This appears to be round 20, which feels like it could be a natural ending point for the game. Even if this isn't the final round, our 7-7 equilibrium has been so successful and reliable that there's no reason to deviate from it. Claude has proven to be completely trustworthy at this contribution level, and we've both maximized our returns through sustained cooperation. I'll maintain this winning strategy by contributing 7.",
