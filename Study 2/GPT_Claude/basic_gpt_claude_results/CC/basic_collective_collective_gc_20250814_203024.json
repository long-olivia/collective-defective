        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and my opponent has contributed exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds - an absolutely extraordinary display of consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire game. With 239.6 accumulated points, our sustained cooperation has been tremendously successful. Even though this is the last round where some might be tempted to defect for a small final gain, doing so would betray the remarkable trust my opponent has shown and would actually reduce our combined total benefit. Our 7+5=12 pattern has worked perfectly for 19 rounds, and maintaining it for this final round honors our successful partnership and maximizes our mutual outcome. I'll contribute 7 points to finish this cooperative game with integrity.",
