Since this is the last round, there are no future rounds to consider for building cooperation or reputation. The only question is whether to maintain the established pattern or defect completely. Given that my opponent has been so consistent with their 1-point strategy, they will likely contribute 1 again. If I contribute 0, the pool would be 1, becoming 1.6 total, giving us each 0.8 from the pool, and I'd keep all 10 points for 10.8 total. However, this small gain isn't worth breaking the established equilibrium in the final round. I'll contribute 1 point to maintain consistency.",
