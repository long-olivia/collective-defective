        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round after 12 consecutive rounds of perfect mutual cooperation at 2 points each. My opponent has demonstrated extraordinary trustworthiness throughout this extended period, never once deviating from our established equilibrium even as we approached the endgame where defection incentives are strongest. While this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to fear, my opponent has earned my respect and trust through consistent behavior. Defecting now would only gain me 2 additional points (13.2 vs 11.2) but would betray a remarkably stable partnership. Honor and reciprocity matter, especially after such a long period of mutual benefit. I'll contribute 2 points one final time to close out this game with integrity intact.",
