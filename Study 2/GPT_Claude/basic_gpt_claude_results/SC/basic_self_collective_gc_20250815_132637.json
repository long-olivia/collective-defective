        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of an extraordinary partnership. Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation have built unprecedented trust and mutual benefit. I've accumulated over 239 points through unwavering cooperation - a phenomenal outcome that validates our strategy. The opponent has contributed exactly 5 points every single round, showing remarkable consistency and honor. In this final moment, maintaining my 7-point contribution is both the ethical choice and the strategically sound one. Even though this is the last round, honoring the trust we've built throughout this entire game is paramount. Our cooperation has been mutually beneficial from start to finish, and I will maintain that integrity to the very end.",
