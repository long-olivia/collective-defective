We have maintained perfect 7-7 cooperation for an incredible 15 consecutive rounds, and I'm at 269.4 points - an exceptional total. My opponent has demonstrated absolutely flawless reliability throughout the entire game, never once deviating from our mutually beneficial strategy. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, which makes defection most tempting. However, my opponent has earned my complete trust through their perfect consistency. If we both contribute 7 one final time, we'll each gain 14.2 points and end with approximately 283.6 points each - a fantastic outcome for both of us. I'll honor our successful partnership to the very end.",
