        "b_reasoning": "My opponent contributed 6 points in round 19 (9 total - 3 from me = 6 from them), incredibly maintaining their cooperative contribution even in the penultimate round despite my increasingly defensive play. This is the final round - round 20 of 20. There are no future rounds to consider, so the traditional logic would be to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points since there's no opportunity for retaliation or future cooperation. However, my opponent has shown remarkable, almost unprecedented consistency and loyalty throughout the entire game, maintaining cooperation even when I became defensive. As a final gesture of respect for their extraordinary reliability, I'll contribute 2 points - enough to show appreciation while still being appropriately defensive in the final round.",
