        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, my opponent contributed 6 points again (6 total - 0 from me = 6 from opponent). This is now the thirteenth consecutive round of exactly 6 points from them, demonstrating absolutely extraordinary consistency throughout the entire game. The pool of 6 became 9.6, giving us each 4.8. I kept all 10 points plus 4.8 from pool = 14.8 total. This is the final round, and my opponent has maintained perfect cooperative behavior despite my complete free-riding for all 19 previous rounds. Since any contribution I make only returns 0.8 points per point contributed (always a net individual loss), and this is the last opportunity to maximize my total, I'll contribute 0 points to achieve the highest possible final score.",
