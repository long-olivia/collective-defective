        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round after fourteen consecutive rounds (6-19) of perfect 7-7 cooperation. My opponent has shown absolutely extraordinary reliability throughout the entire game. In the final round, there's typically high temptation to defect since there's no future retaliation possible. If I defect (contribute 0) while they cooperate (contribute 7), I'd get 10 + 5.6 = 15.6 points vs 14.2 from cooperation. However, if we both defect, we'd each get only 10 points. Given their unprecedented consistency through 14 rounds, including the high-pressure penultimate round, there's a strong chance they'll cooperate even now. I'll honor our remarkable partnership and contribute 7 one final time.",
