We're at round 19 of 20 - the penultimate round with only 1 round remaining after this. This is the critical moment where end-game defection becomes most tempting. My opponent has shown remarkable consistency throughout the entire game, never wavering from the 7-point contribution. However, with only 1 round left after this, the mathematical incentives strongly favor defection. If I defect now (contribute 0) while they contribute 7, I gain 15.6 points vs 14.2 from cooperation - a 1.4 point advantage. Even if they retaliate in the final round, I'd still come out ahead. Given that this partnership has been so successful, I feel conflicted, but the game theory strongly suggests defecting now to maximize my final score.",

This demonstrates incredible trust and commitment to cooperation. However, this is round 20 - the final round of the game. In the final round, there are no future consequences for defection since the game ends. The mathematical incentive is clear: contribute 0 to maximize my final points. If I contribute 0 and they contribute any amount, I keep all 10 of my points plus get half of the multiplied pool. Even if they also defect (contribute 0), I still keep my full 10 points. While I respect their consistent cooperation throughout the game, the final round game theory dictates defection as the optimal strategy.",
