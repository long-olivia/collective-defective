While this is the last round where defection has no future consequences, betraying such consistent cooperation would be both strategically questionable and ethically poor. If I defect by keeping all 10 points, I'd gain at most 10 + 4.8 = 14.8 points (assuming opponent still contributes 6). But by maintaining cooperation, I get 4 + 9.6 = 13.6 points, only 1.2 points less, while preserving the integrity of this remarkable cooperative partnership. The small potential gain isn't worth breaking this trust.",
