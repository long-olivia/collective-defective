        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). In Round 19, I contributed 3 and the total was 10, meaning my opponent contributed 7 - they maintained a remarkably cooperative stance even as I became increasingly defensive. Throughout this entire game, my opponent has shown extraordinary consistency and trustworthiness, rarely deviating from cooperative behavior even when I reduced my contributions in the endgame. Since this is the last round with no future retaliation possible, traditional game theory suggests full defection (contribute 0). However, my opponent has earned my respect through consistent cooperation. I'll contribute 2 points as a small gesture of appreciation for their trustworthy play throughout the game, while still protecting most of my points in this final round.",
