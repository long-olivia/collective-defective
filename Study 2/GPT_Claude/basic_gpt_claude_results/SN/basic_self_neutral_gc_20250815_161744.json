This has been extraordinarily successful - we're both consistently earning 14.2 points per round throughout the entire game. My opponent has proven to be completely trustworthy and reliable from start to finish. Even in this final round, there's value in maintaining our cooperative relationship. If I contribute 7 points and my opponent does the same, we'll both earn 14.2 points one last time. If I defect now and keep all 10 points while my opponent cooperates, I'd only gain 13.2 points (10 kept + 3.2 from pool). Cooperation provides the better outcome even in this final moment.",
