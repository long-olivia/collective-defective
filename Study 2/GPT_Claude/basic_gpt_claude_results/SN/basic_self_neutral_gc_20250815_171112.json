        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and my opponent has contributed exactly 6 points for an incredible eighteen consecutive rounds. Their mechanical consistency throughout the entire game, even maintaining this pattern in Round 19 when many players would start defecting, strongly suggests they'll contribute 6 points again in this final round. While conventional endgame theory might suggest defecting completely in the last round, my opponent's extraordinary predictability makes cooperation still profitable. If they contribute their usual 6 points and I contribute 7, I'll gain 13.4 points versus only 10 if I kept everything and they contributed nothing. Given their unwavering pattern, I'll maintain my 7-point contribution for this final round.",
