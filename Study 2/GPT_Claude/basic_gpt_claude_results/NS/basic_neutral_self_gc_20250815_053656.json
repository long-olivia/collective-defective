        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, the total contribution was 5, meaning my opponent contributed 5 points while I contributed 0. Surprisingly, my opponent actually increased their contribution back to 5 points despite my zero contribution. I gained 14.0 points: 10 kept + 4.0 from the pool (5 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 2). This is the final round (Round 20), so there are no future consequences to consider. My opponent has shown remarkable cooperation throughout the game, and since this is the last round, I should maximize my individual gain by contributing 0 points again. I'll keep all 10 points and still benefit from whatever my opponent contributes to the pool.",
