        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and my opponent contributed 6 points again in round 19 (12 total - 6 mine = 6 theirs), completing twelve consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation. They have demonstrated unwavering commitment to our mutually beneficial strategy throughout the entire second half of the game. In this final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, making defection theoretically attractive. However, my opponent has earned my trust through consistent cooperation. Our 6-6 strategy still yields 13.6 points versus 10 from defecting. Given their remarkable consistency, I believe they'll cooperate one final time. I'll honor our partnership and contribute 6 points to end this game with mutual respect and optimal joint outcomes.",
