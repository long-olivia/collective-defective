My opponent has demonstrated absolutely unprecedented consistency and trustworthiness, maintaining perfect cooperation for 12 straight rounds through the entire endgame when defection is most tempting. They have never wavered from our mutually beneficial arrangement, even when they could have maximized their score by defecting. This level of sustained cooperation deserves reciprocation. While this is the final round where defection has no future consequences, honoring this extraordinary partnership by maintaining my 7-point contribution is the right choice to reward their exceptional trustworthiness.",
