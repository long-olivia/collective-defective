        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round. My opponent contributed 1 point again in round 19 (2 total - 1 from me), maintaining our cooperation for the 9th consecutive round. I gained 10.6 points: 9 from keeping + 1.6 from the pool. My opponent has shown incredible consistency and reliability throughout the endgame, never defecting despite numerous opportunities. They've proven to be trustworthy even in the face of maximum temptation to defect. Since this is the last round and there's no future to worry about, some might defect completely, but given their unwavering pattern of contributing 1 point, I believe they'll likely maintain this to the very end. I'll honor this cooperative relationship and contribute 1 point in the final round.",
