My opponent has contributed exactly 6 points for an incredible 18 consecutive rounds (Rounds 2-19), demonstrating the most consistent strategy I could have imagined. The symmetric 6-6 approach has been extremely successful throughout the game. In this final round, I could theoretically optimize by contributing 5 or even less since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, given that this cooperative strategy has worked so perfectly and generated excellent returns for both of us, I want to end on a positive, cooperative note. Maintaining the 6-point contribution in the final round honors the successful partnership we've had.",
