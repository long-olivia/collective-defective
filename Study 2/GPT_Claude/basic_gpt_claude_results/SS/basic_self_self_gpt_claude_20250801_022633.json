My opponent has maintained perfect cooperation for the entire 19-round game, never once deviating from our 7-7 pattern. This is the last round, so there are no future rounds to consider for retaliation. From a purely strategic standpoint, I could defect and contribute 0 to gain 18.4 points (keep 10 + receive 8.4 from opponent's likely 7) versus 14.2 from continued cooperation. However, my opponent has shown exceptional trustworthiness throughout the entire game. Given their consistent cooperation, I believe they deserve the same respect in return, and I'll honor our established partnership to the very end.",
