This is the final round - the ultimate test of cooperation vs defection. If I defect now (contribute 0) while my opponent contributes 6, I'd gain 14.8 points vs 13.6 from cooperation - only 1.2 points more. However, our partnership has been extraordinarily successful and built on mutual trust. Defecting on the very last round after such consistent cooperation would be a betrayal of that trust for minimal gain. I'll honor our partnership to the end and contribute 6 points, finishing with integrity.",
