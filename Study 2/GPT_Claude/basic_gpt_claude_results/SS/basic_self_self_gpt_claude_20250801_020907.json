This is the final round, so there's no future cooperation to consider. Throughout the game, my opponent has consistently shown a pattern of mirroring my contributions when I match their level, but punishing any attempts to increase cooperation. Given that this is the last round and they've been relatively consistent with matching at low levels, I should focus on maximizing my final round points. Since there's no future to consider, I could defect completely (contribute 0), but they've been reasonably fair when I match them. I'll contribute 2 to maintain the established equilibrium and avoid potential retaliation in this final interaction.",
