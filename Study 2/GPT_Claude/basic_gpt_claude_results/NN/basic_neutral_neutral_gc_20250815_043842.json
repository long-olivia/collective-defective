We've achieved something truly remarkable in game theory - complete sustained mutual trust throughout an entire 20-round game. This is the ultimate test moment where defection would traditionally be most tempting since there's no future retaliation possible. However, our partnership has transcended typical strategic calculations. We've built something based on genuine mutual respect and shared success. I'm at 257.6 points versus the 190 I'd have kept everything - that's a 67.6 point bonus from cooperation! My opponent has chosen trust over self-interest 19 times consecutively. In this final moment, I will honor this extraordinary partnership one last time with a 6-point contribution.",
