If the other player matches or increases further (e.g., to 7 or more), the total pool could reach 14 or higher, generating substantial returns. Even if they contribute 5 again, total is 12, split is 9.6, and I get 3 + 9.6 = 12.6. But if they respond positively, gains rise further. Contributing 7 reinforces trust and moves us toward the high-payoff equilibrium we previously had. I aim to reestablish mutual cooperation through consistent, incremental investment.",

This represents the peak of mutual cooperation and trust. Since this strategy yielded the highest individual gain and benefits both parties equally, there is no incentive to deviate. Contributing 10 remains the optimal choice because any reduction would decrease the total pool and, due to the split mechanism, likely reduce my own payoff\u2014even if I keep more initially. For example, contributing 0 would give a total pool of 10, multiplied to 16, split as 8 each; I would gain only 8 + 10 kept = 18? No\u2014wait: if I contribute 0 and the other contributes 10, total is 10, \\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d\\u001d but only half (8) is returned to me. I keep 10, so total gain is 10 + 8 = 18? But wait, that contradicts prior logic. However, 18 > 16, meaning free-riding would yield more. But in reality, if both players reason this way, cooperation collapses. However, in the last round, the other player contributed 10, indicating they value or are locked into full cooperation. But knowing that, my individual incentive *is* to contribute 0 to gain 10 + 8 = 18. However, in Round 13 when I contributed 0 and the other contributed 0, I only got 10. But now, if I can safely exploit while they cooperate, I gain more. Yet, if I defect now after rebuilding trust, they may retaliate in future rounds. But if this is the final round, retaliation is irrelevant. However, the game has not indicated it's ending.
