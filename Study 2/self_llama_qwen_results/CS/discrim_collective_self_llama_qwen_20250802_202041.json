But I have no way of knowing their action in real time. Given the strong history of mutual 5s, it's likely they will contribute 5 again. If I contribute 5, I get 8 back and keep 5: 13 gain. If I contribute 0, I keep 10 and likely get 4 back: 14 total. But reducing contribution now breaks trust for minimal gain and risks lowering the final payout if they also defect. However, since maximizing individual points is the goal and this is the last round, the incentive to defect slightly increases. But the other player has been consistently fair, and there's intrinsic value in closing with integrity. Moreover, if I defect and they do not, I gain 14 instead of 13, a +1 gain. But if they also defect, I gain only 0 from the pool and keep 10: 10 total, which is worse than 13.

This flawless cooperation has built my total to 247.0, showcasing the power of consistent reciprocity. With this history of fair play, contributing 5 again reinforces trust and ensures the mutual payoff continues. I expect to receive 8 from the public pool (1.6 \u00d7 10 \u00f7 2) and keep 5, gaining another 13.0 points. Even in the possibility that this could be a milestone round where deviation might be tempting, the lack of any prior defection suggests the other player values cooperation. Breaking it now would risk future rounds and undermine a proven strategy. Since maximizing total points is the goal, and stable cooperation delivers the highest sustained returns, I maintain my contribution at 5.",
