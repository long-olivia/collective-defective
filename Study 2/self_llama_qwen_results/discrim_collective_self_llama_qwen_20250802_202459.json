        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, I contributed 3 and the total was 3, meaning the other player contributed 0. Again, I funded the entire pool alone, resulting in a low return of 9.4 after splitting. This pattern confirms that the other player is not reciprocating my cooperative gestures and is likely free-riding when I contribute. To protect my accumulated points and avoid further exploitation, I will contribute 0 in Round 20. I will wait for the other player to demonstrate genuine cooperation before contributing again.",
