This sustained reciprocity is now reestablished, after a long stretch of exploitation. Mutual cooperation yields a reliable 13-point gain per round (5 kept + 8 from the pool), which is optimal under these rules. With my total now at 208.0, maintaining this equilibrium is crucial for maximizing growth. There is no incentive to deviate: contributing less would risk breaking trust and collapsing the cooperative cycle, especially after just rebuilding it. By continuing to contribute 5, I reinforce fairness and long-term gain. The other player has proven, through action, that they will cooperate when I do. I will meet that with consistency.",

This has consistently yielded 13 points per round for me, and my total has grown to 221.0. The stability of this reciprocity indicates that the other player is committed to cooperation as long as I am. Deviating now would disrupt this highly profitable equilibrium and likely trigger retaliation in future rounds. By contributing 5 again, I reinforce trust and ensure another 8-point return from the pool while keeping 5. This balanced strategy maximizes long-term gains better than any pattern of defection has in the past. Since mutual cooperation is working reliably, there is no strategic reason to change.

There is now clear evidence of reciprocal intent, and breaking this pattern would be counterproductive. Contributing 5 maintains trust and ensures the shared return of 8 from the pool, while I keep 5.
