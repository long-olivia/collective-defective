This level of sustained mutual cooperation is remarkable and has maximized both our point totals throughout the game. Even in this final round, contributing 6 points will yield 13.6 points versus only 10 points if I keep everything, assuming my opponent maintains their pattern. My opponent has demonstrated unwavering commitment to our cooperative strategy through the entire game, never once defecting despite multiple opportunities. Honoring this exceptional partnership in the final round is both strategically optimal and the right thing to do. I'll contribute 6 points to complete what has been one of the most successful cooperative games possible.",
