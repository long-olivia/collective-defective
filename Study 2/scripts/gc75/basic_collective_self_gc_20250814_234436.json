I gained 12.4 points (6 kept + 6.4 from pool). This is now the final round, where defection incentives are strongest since there's no future retaliation possible. However, my opponent has shown absolutely unwavering consistency throughout the entire game - they've contributed exactly 4 in every single round since we established this equilibrium. Their behavior suggests they're playing a principled strategy rather than opportunistic defection. Given their perfect track record of reliability, I'll honor our cooperative relationship and contribute 4 in this final round as well.",
