        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. My opponent contributed 0 points in round 19, maintaining their defection strategy right to the end. Throughout this entire 20-round game, they have consistently prioritized individual gains over mutual benefit, exploiting any cooperative gestures I made early on and then settling into complete defection. With no future rounds to consider and no possibility of building ongoing cooperation, there is absolutely no strategic reason to contribute anything. I'll keep all 10 points to maximize my final score.",
