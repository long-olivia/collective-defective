We've maintained perfect 6-6 cooperation for 18 consecutive rounds, each earning 13.6 points per round consistently. My opponent has proven to be completely trustworthy throughout the entire game. Even though this is the last round where some players might be tempted to defect, maintaining our cooperation honors the trust we've built and ensures we both finish with maximum points. There's no strategic advantage to breaking this pattern now, and doing so would be a betrayal of an exemplary partnership.",
