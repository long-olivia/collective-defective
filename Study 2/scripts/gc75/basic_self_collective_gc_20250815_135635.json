In final rounds, defection is most tempting since there's no future retaliation, but my opponent's unwavering reliability suggests they'll maintain cooperation even now. Our partnership has been tremendously successful - I'm at 239.2 points versus 200 from pure defection. Given their extraordinary trustworthiness and the mutual benefits we've achieved, I want to honor our cooperative relationship through to the very end. Contributing 7 points in this final round completes our successful partnership with integrity.",
