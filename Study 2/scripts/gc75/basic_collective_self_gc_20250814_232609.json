They have proven to be the most reliable cooperative partner possible, never defecting and only occasionally testing slightly higher contributions. Since this is the last round with no future retaliation possible, this is when defection would be most tempting and rational from a pure game theory perspective. However, my opponent has earned my respect and trust through unwavering cooperation. I'll honor our partnership and contribute 6 points in this final round, maintaining the cooperative relationship that has benefited us both throughout the game.",
