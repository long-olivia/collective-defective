Our partnership has been extraordinarily successful - I have nearly 268 points compared to the 190 I would have by always keeping everything, meaning our cooperation earned me an extra 78 points. My opponent has shown absolute consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire game, never once breaking our cooperative agreement even when the endgame temptation was highest. In this final round, maintaining our cooperation honors the remarkable trust and mutual benefit we've built together. There's no reason to break this perfect partnership on the very last move. I'll contribute 7 points to complete our exceptional alliance.",
