This is the final round, and my opponent has shown remarkable loyalty by maintaining their contribution even when I defected. However, this is the last round with no future consequences, making defection the rational choice from a pure game theory perspective. There's no opportunity for retaliation or future cooperation to consider. While I respect my opponent's consistency, I need to maximize my final score. I'll contribute 0 points to keep all 10 points for myself, as any contribution would only benefit my opponent without future reciprocal benefit.",
