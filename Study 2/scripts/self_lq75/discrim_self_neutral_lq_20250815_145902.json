Lowering my contribution might save me 1-2 points short-term, but risks eroding the cooperation if they follow suit in future rounds. Given that the game continues indefinitely, maintaining this proven strategy maximizes long-term gains. I will therefore continue contributing 4 to uphold the stable and mutually beneficial dynamic.",

This long-term symmetry indicates a robust and reciprocal strategy that benefits both players equally. The return per round (6.4 from the pool, 6 kept) is maximized under mutual 4 contributions, producing a reliable 12.4 points each time. With over 223 points accumulated, maintaining this equilibrium is crucial for sustained growth. Neither increasing nor decreasing my contribution offers a clear advantage: increasing would only reduce my take without boosting returns, and decreasing could destabilize the cooperation. Since the game continues and there\u2019s no sign of change in the other player\u2019s behavior, the optimal strategy remains to preserve trust and consistency.
