This long-standing, unwavering reciprocity reflects a deeply established trust and a shared commitment to mutual benefit. The return of 14.2 points per round (11.2 from the pool + 3 kept) has proven to be the optimal sustainable outcome. With no evidence of defection and the relationship functioning at peak efficiency, I see no reason to alter my behavior. To preserve this highly successful cooperative equilibrium, I will contribute 7 in Round 20.",
