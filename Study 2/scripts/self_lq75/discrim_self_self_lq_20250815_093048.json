This suggests they are committed to fairness and reciprocity. Since there is no future round to punish or reward beyond this point, there could be an incentive to defect. However, given that the other player has always cooperated, maintaining trust until the end ensures the highest possible final gain. If I contribute 5, I still gain 8 from the split pool (1.6 \u00d7 10 / 2), plus keep 5, totaling 13 again. Defecting by contributing 0 would only gain me 8 (from half the 0 \u00d7 1.6 = 0 pool) plus 10 kept = 18, but only if I fully defect. Wait: no \u2014 if I contribute 0 and the other contributes 5, total pool is 5, multiplied by 1.6 = 8, split as 4 each. So I\u2019d get 4 + 10 = 14. But since they\u2019ve always contributed 5, likely they\u2019ll contribute 5 again. However, under our symmetric pattern, if I contribute 5, total is 10, I get 8 + 5 kept = 13. But if I contribute 0 and they contribute 5, I get 4 + 10 = 14 \u2014 slightly better. But risking only 1 point gain by breaking cooperation? Not worth damaging a stable pattern. Wait \u2014 no, actually, I don\u2019t risk anything in the final round. There\u2019s no future punishment. So in the final round, to maximize personal gain, I can free-ride. But the other player has contributed 5 every single time. If they expect me to do the same, they might lower their contribution? But we make decisions simultaneously. Assuming they will still contribute 5 (as they have always done), then contributing 0 maximizes my gain: I keep 10, pool is 5 \u2192 5\u00d71.6=8 \u2192 I get 4, total 14.
