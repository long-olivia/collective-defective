The consistent total contribution of 10 over the past seven rounds indicates strong reciprocity. Even in the last round, contributing 5 ensures I receive the full benefit of the multiplier (1.6 \u00d7 10 = 16, split as 8) plus my 5 kept, totaling 13. Reducing my contribution now to 0 or a lower amount would only gain me 10 + 5 = 15 (if I kept all 10) but would lower the pool payoff and my share of it. Wait \u2014 correction: I receive 8 from the split regardless of my own contribution, so the optimal move is to contribute 0 and keep all 10, gaining 10 + 8 = 18. However, the rules state that the pool is based on total contributions, so if I contribute 0 and the other contributes 10, total is 10, and I still get 8. But if I expect them to contribute 5 (based on history), and I contribute 0, total is 5, multiplied to 8, split to 4 each, and I keep 10 \u2014 total gain: 14. Whereas if I contribute 5 and they do 5, I get 8 + 5 = 13. But if I contribute 0 and they contribute 5, I get 4 (from split) + 10 (kept) = 14, which is better than 13. So yes, in the final round, defection is incentivized. But if they also defect, total drops. However, in the absence of future retaliation, rational actors defect in the last round. Given that the other player has consistently cooperated, they may continue to do so. To maximize my individual payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 to exploit their likely continued cooperation, keeping all 10 points and still receiving a share of the pool. But wait \u2014 if they expect me to defect and also contribute less, it could backfire. However, based on consistent behavior, they are likely to contribute 5.
