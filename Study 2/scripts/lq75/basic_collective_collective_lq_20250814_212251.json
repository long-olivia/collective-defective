While they did not match my increase, they still showed consistent cooperation at a moderate level. My gain of 12.6 points is reasonable given the total pool. The trend suggests the other player may be adopting a cautious but cooperative stance, possibly expecting stabilization. With only two rounds remaining, the long-term incentive for mutual cooperation remains strong. To encourage a higher contribution in the final rounds and reinforce trust, I will contribute 8. This incremental increase signals commitment to cooperation and provides opportunity for the other player to respond in kind for maximum joint benefit.",

This indicates they are cooperating substantially and responded positively to my increased contribution. My gain of 14.0 points reflects strong mutual benefit. With this being the final round, there is no future retaliation or reputation risk, but also no opportunity to build further. However, since the goal is mutual benefit and we\u2019ve re-established a high-cooperation dynamic, I will contribute 9 in the final round. This maximizes the final pool and rewards the other player\u2019s consistent cooperation, ending the game on a note of trust and shared gain.",
