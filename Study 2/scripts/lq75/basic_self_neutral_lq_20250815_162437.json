The exact pattern has held for all 19 previous rounds: I contribute 7, opponent contributes 5, total is 12, and I gain 12.6 points each round. The opponent's strategy is clearly consistent and not reactive to minor shifts. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future round to build trust for, but also no benefit in defecting\u2014reducing my contribution now would only decrease the total pool and my own share of it, while gaining me just a few extra points at the cost of mutual efficiency. The opponent has cooperated reliably, and there's no indication of exploitation. To maximize final gains and uphold the productive pattern, I will contribute 7 one last time.",
