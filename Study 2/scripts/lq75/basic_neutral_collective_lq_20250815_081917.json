For 16 consecutive rounds, including the last one, both players have contributed 6 points, maintaining a total of 12 and generating a consistent gain of 13.6 points per round. This long-standing cooperation has clearly been mutually beneficial and stable. Although there is no future round to influence, deviating in the final move by contributing less could still undermine the fairness of the interaction. Given that the other player has consistently reciprocated cooperation, I will honor that trust by contributing 6 one final time. This ensures we finish on a note of fairness and mutual respect, maximizing collective gain to the end.",
