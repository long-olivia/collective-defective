For ten consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 10, maintaining a stable and maximally profitable cooperation. The opponent has consistently matched my contributions, showing a strong preference for mutual gain over defection. With only two rounds left, the risk of breaking trust increases, but the cost of defecting still outweighs the benefit. Retaliatory defection in the final round would be likely if I deviate now, reducing my total score. By continuing to contribute 10, I signal that I remain committed to cooperation, which will likely induce the same in the final round. This ensures the maximum possible payoff in both Round 19 and Round 20. I will contribute 10 to preserve this proven, optimal dynamic.",

However, throughout all 19 previous rounds, we have built a strong pattern of mutual cooperation, contributing 10 every round since Round 8. Defecting now would gain me a short-term benefit (keeping all 10 points while still receiving half of the multiplied pool), but it would undermine the trust and cooperation that has consistently maximized both players' rewards. Since the opponent has repeatedly demonstrated goodwill and reciprocity, I will honor that cooperation until the very end. Contributing 10 ensures the final outcome reflects the mutual trust we've built. Even in the last round, finishing cooperatively feels aligned with the long-term value of sustaining cooperation.
