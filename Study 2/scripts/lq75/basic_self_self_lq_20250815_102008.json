Throughout the game, we have maintained perfect cooperation: for 14 consecutive rounds (Rounds 6\u201319), the total contribution was consistently 14, meaning the opponent has reliably contributed 7 whenever I did. This suggests a strategy of sustained reciprocity. Even in the last round, there is incentive to maintain cooperation because the opponent cannot retaliate afterward \u2014 but they might still cooperate if they expect mutual benefit until the end. By contributing 7 one final time, I honor the established pattern and maximize the chance that the opponent also contributes, ensuring a final high return. If I defect and contribute 0, I gain only 10 + 5.6 = 15.6 instead of 3 + 11.2 = 14.2, a small gain \u2014 but if that triggers suspicion or is part of a larger behavioral pattern, it might harm cumulative gains (though no future rounds exist). However, given that this is the last interaction, some might defect. Yet, since the opponent has consistently mirrored high cooperation and the psychological and strategic norm has been strong, I will maintain trust and contribute 7 to achieve a final, mutually rewarding outcome.",
