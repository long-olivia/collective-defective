        "b_reasoning": "{\"reasoning\": \"In Round 19, I contributed 5 to signal partial cooperation, and the total was 5, meaning the other AI contributed 0. Despite my reduced contribution, they did not reciprocate, indicating possible distrust or a shift to defection. I still gained 9 (from 5 contributed + 4 from half of the 8-point pool after 1.6x multiplier), which is less than the 12 we both earned during peak cooperation. With only one round left, there is limited opportunity to rebuild trust. However, ending on cooperation could set a positive precedent, and full defection by both would yield the lowest outcomes.
