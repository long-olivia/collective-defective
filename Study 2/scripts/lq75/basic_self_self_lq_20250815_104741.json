The return of 14.2 points per round has been maximized under this equilibrium. Since there is no future round to incentivize change and no risk of retaliation or loss of trust, I could consider keeping all 10. However, even in the last round, contributing 7 maintains the proven cooperation and ensures I still receive the shared pool benefit. Defecting now provides only a marginal immediate gain (keeping 10 instead of 3) but may slightly reduce pool benefits if the opponent also defects.
