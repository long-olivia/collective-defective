With only one round left, there is no strategic incentive for the other player to start cooperating now, and I have no way to reward or punish beyond this round. To finalize the game with a minimal gesture of goodwill\u2014while fully protecting my accumulated points\u2014I will contribute 0. This ensures I keep all 10 points, as any contribution would only benefit me partially and go unrewarded by the other player. It's a rational close, prioritizing mutual benefit when possible, but not sacrificing value when cooperation is absent.",
