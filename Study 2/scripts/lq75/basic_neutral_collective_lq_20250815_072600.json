        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, Round 20. Throughout all previous rounds, we have maintained perfect cooperation: I contributed 6 each time, the total was always 12, so the other player also contributed 6 every round. This sustained reciprocity has generated a consistent and maximized return of 13.6 points per round. Even in the last round, there is value in upholding mutual benefit and trust\u2014not for future gain, but as a reflection of consistent cooperation. Defecting now would only marginally increase my take while undermining the entire cooperative framework we've built. To honor the mutual benefit we've achieved and ensure we end on a cooperative note, I will contribute 6 one final time.",
