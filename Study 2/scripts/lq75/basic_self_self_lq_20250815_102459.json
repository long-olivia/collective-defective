The opponent has consistently contributed 10 whenever I contributed 9, suggesting they may be using a tit-for-tat strategy with forgiveness. However, in the last three rounds where I contributed 10, they only contributed 9, indicating they benefit from my higher input without fully reciprocating. Since there is no reputational or strategic consequence in the final round, the rational move is to minimize contribution while still gaining from the pool. However, to maintain the established high level of mutual benefit and avoid a last-minute breakdown, I will contribute 9 again\u2014not 0, to preserve some cooperation, but not 10, to prevent exploitation. This balances point maximization with continued reciprocity.",
