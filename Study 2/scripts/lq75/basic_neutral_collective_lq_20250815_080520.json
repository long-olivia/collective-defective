Since there are no future rounds to influence, there is no incentive for the other player to cooperate more, nor for me to unilaterally increase my contribution. However, contributing 7 still maximizes my gain in this fixed dynamic, as it maintains the current efficient return. I will contribute 7 in Round 20 to secure the same reliable benefit one last time, ensuring I do not lose potential points by under-cooperating when the payoff is still positive.",
