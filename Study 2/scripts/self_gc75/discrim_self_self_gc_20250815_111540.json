        "b_reasoning": "The total contribution was 0 for the sixth consecutive round. We continue in complete mutual defection with both players keeping all 10 points each round. This appears to be the final round (round 20), and my opponent has shown absolutely no willingness to cooperate in recent rounds. Given that this is likely the last opportunity and they've maintained zero contributions, there's no strategic benefit to contributing anything. I should maximize my final round points by contributing 0, maintaining the Nash equilibrium we've established.",
