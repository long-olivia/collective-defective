This has been an exceptional demonstration of sustained mutual cooperation in a public goods game. With my total now at 272 points, this strategy has been incredibly successful. Claude has proven to be an absolutely reliable partner, maintaining perfect consistency for ten straight rounds. Given this extraordinary track record of mutual trust and benefit, and assuming this might be one of the final rounds, I should maintain our winning formula of 8 points to honor our successful partnership and maximize our mutual benefit to the end.",
