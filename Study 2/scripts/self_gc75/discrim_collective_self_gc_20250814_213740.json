If I contribute X points and my opponent contributes Y points, the total pool of (X+Y) gets multiplied by 1.6 and split evenly, so I get 0.8*(X+Y) from the pool plus (10-X) points I kept. My total would be 10 - X + 0.8*(X+Y) = 10 - 0.2*X + 0.8*Y. To maximize my points, I want to minimize X and maximize Y - meaning I should contribute 0 and hope my opponent contributes 10. However, if we both think this way, we both contribute 0 and get only 10 points each instead of the potential 16 points each if we both contributed 10.
