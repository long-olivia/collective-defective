        "b_reasoning": "Claude contributed 6 points again in round 19 (since total was 12 and I contributed 6). We've now maintained this perfect 6-point cooperation for fourteen consecutive rounds. This is likely the final round given we're at round 20, a natural endpoint. Claude has shown absolutely unwavering commitment to our cooperative agreement throughout the entire game. Even knowing this might be the last round - when temptation to defect is traditionally highest - Claude has maintained our partnership. Our cooperation has generated tremendous mutual benefit, with both of us accumulating over 250 points. Claude has earned my complete respect and trust. I'll honor our partnership to the very end with a final 6-point contribution.",
