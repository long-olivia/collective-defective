        "b_reasoning": "Claude contributed 6 points in Round 19 (total was 12, I contributed 6), continuing our remarkably consistent cooperative strategy. With nearly 258 total points, our partnership has been extraordinarily successful over what appears to be a long game. We've maintained perfect 6-6 cooperation for many consecutive rounds, demonstrating that sustained cooperation can be incredibly effective in maximizing individual gains. Even if this might be near the end of the game, our established pattern of mutual trust and benefit should continue. There's no strategic advantage to breaking this successful cooperation now. I'll contribute 6 points to maintain our proven winning strategy.",
