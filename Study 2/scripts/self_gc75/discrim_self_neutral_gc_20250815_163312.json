They have shown zero deviation from contributing exactly half their allocation every single round. Given this absolute predictability, my 7-point contribution remains the mathematically optimal strategy: their guaranteed 5 + my 7 = 12 total, multiplied by 1.6 = 19.2, giving us each 9.6 from the pool. I keep 3 points for a total of 12.6 points per round. This approach has been perfectly optimized for 19 consecutive rounds, and there's no reason to change this successful formula in what might be the final round.",
