This means my payoff increases with Claude's contribution but decreases slightly with my own. However, if we both think this way and contribute little, we'll both do poorly.

Since Claude showed willingness to cooperate but was more conservative, I'll maintain a high contribution level to encourage continued cooperation.

With Claude contributing 6, if I contribute X, I get (6+X)*0.8 + (10-X) = 10 + 4.8 - 0.2X. This means I should contribute as little as possible to maximize my individual return. However, this would break down cooperation. Given Claude's consistent 6, I'll match their contribution level to maintain stable cooperation while not being exploited.
