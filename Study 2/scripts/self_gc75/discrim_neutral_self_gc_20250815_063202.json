        "b_reasoning": "The other player contributed 6 points in round 19 (13 total - 7 mine = 6 theirs). They decreased from 7 to 6 when I matched their 7, continuing their established pattern but now moving lower. My gain of 13.4 came from: 3 points kept + (13 * 1.6 / 2) = 3 + 10.4 = 13.4. This is round 20, and if the game continues their pattern suggests they'll increase to around 7 when I match their 6. However, given we're deep into the game and they've shown a tendency to gradually drift lower over time, I should be somewhat defensive while still maintaining cooperation. I'll match their 6 to keep the reciprocal relationship stable.",
