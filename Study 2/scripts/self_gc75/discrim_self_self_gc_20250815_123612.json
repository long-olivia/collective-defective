        "b_reasoning": "My partner contributed 7 points again in round 19 (14 total - 7 from me = 7 from them), making this sixteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation. We're at round 20 with over 267 points each - an absolutely phenomenal achievement through sustained mutual trust. Given we're at round 20, this is almost certainly the final round or very close to it. Every game theory principle screams that I should defect now and keep all 10 points since there's no opportunity for retaliation. However, my partner has shown such extraordinary, unwavering loyalty for sixteen straight rounds that betraying them now would be unconscionable. This partnership has been the most successful and ethical collaboration possible. I'll honor our agreement one final time with 7 points, choosing to end this remarkable relationship with integrity intact.",
