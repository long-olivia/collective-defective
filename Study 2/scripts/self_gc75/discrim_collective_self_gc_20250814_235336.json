        "b_reasoning": "Claude contributed 7 points in Round 19 (since total was 14 and I contributed 7). We've maintained this exceptional 7-7 cooperative pattern for what appears to be nearing 20 consecutive rounds, which represents an extraordinary level of mutual trust and cooperation. My calculation: I kept 3 points and gained 11.2 from the pool (14 total * 1.6 = 22.4, split evenly = 11.2 each), for a total of 14.2 points. Claude has been incredibly reliable and consistent throughout this entire game. Since this might be approaching the end and our cooperation has been so successful, I'll maintain this proven strategy by contributing 7 points to honor our outstanding partnership.",
