We each received 12.8 points from the pool, plus I kept 2 points, giving me 14.8 total for that round. We've now maintained perfect synchronization at 8 points for six consecutive rounds, establishing one of the most stable cooperative partnerships possible in this game. This could very well be the final round given we're at Round 20, and our sustained cooperation has been extraordinarily successful. As a gesture of appreciation for Claude's consistent reliability and to end on the highest possible note of mutual benefit, I'll contribute 9 points - showing trust and gratitude for our excellent partnership while maximizing our collective gain in what may be our final interaction.",
