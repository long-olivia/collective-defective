Round 20 feels significant - possibly a final round given the milestone number. Throughout this game, we've demonstrated that mutual trust and consistent cooperation create far superior outcomes than any selfish approach. Our 7-point strategy has been optimal, earning us 42% more points per round than selfish play. Whether this is the final round or not, I'll honor our exceptional partnership by maintaining the cooperative approach that has served us both so well.",
