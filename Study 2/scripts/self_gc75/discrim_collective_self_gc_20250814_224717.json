However, there's a risk that Claude might defect and contribute less, taking advantage of my contribution. To start, I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) to signal cooperation while keeping a small buffer in case Claude doesn't reciprocate fully.

Since we both showed similar cooperative behavior, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points this round to signal even stronger cooperation and test if Claude will match this level of trust.
