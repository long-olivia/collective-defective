This increase from 5 to 6 gave me a higher return of 14.2 points (kept 7 + received 0.8*9 = 7.2). This could indicate Claude is testing a slight increase in cooperation, possibly in response to the game continuing longer than expected, or they might be trying to encourage mutual increases in contribution. Since Claude increased their contribution when I reduced mine to 3, they seem to be prioritizing the total pool size. I'll maintain 3 to see if Claude continues with 6, which would give us a stable total of 9 and good returns for both.",
