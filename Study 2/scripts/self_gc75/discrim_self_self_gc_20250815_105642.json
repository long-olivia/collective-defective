This appears to be the final round (Round 20), and we've maintained this minimal cooperation equilibrium for half the entire game. Since this is likely the last opportunity to gain points, and Claude has shown zero deviation from their 1-point strategy regardless of circumstances, I should stick with contributing 1 point. This gives me 10.6 points (9 kept + 1.6 from pool) versus 10.0 if I contributed nothing. There's no strategic advantage to changing in the final round when the pattern is so established.",
