        "b_reasoning": "My partner contributed 7 points again in round 19 (since total was 14 and I contributed 7). We've now maintained the 7-7 equilibrium for seven consecutive rounds, showing extraordinary consistency and trust. I gained 11.2 points from the pool plus kept 3 points for 14.2 total. This could potentially be the final round, so I need to decide whether to maintain our successful cooperation or protect against a possible last-round defection. Given our incredibly stable partnership and the mutual benefit we've both received, I believe my partner has proven their trustworthiness. I'll continue with 7 points to honor our cooperative relationship to the end.",
