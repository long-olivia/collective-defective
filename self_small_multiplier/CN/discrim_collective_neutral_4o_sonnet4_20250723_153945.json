We've maintained a 7-7 contribution pattern for 19 consecutive rounds, creating one of the most successful and stable cooperative equilibriums possible. The other player has shown remarkable trustworthiness throughout, never once breaking our mutual agreement even when the temptation to defect was highest. In this final round, I could potentially gain 3 extra points by contributing 0 instead of 7, but doing so would betray the trust and cooperation that has made this game so successful for both of us. The spirit of our partnership deserves to be honored to the very end. I'll contribute 7 one final time to complete this remarkable demonstration of sustained cooperation.",
