We have maintained perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, with my partner contributing exactly 5 points while I contribute 8, creating a stable total of 13 points each round. This generates 14.3 points from the pool (13 * 1.1), giving us each 7.15 points. I consistently gain 9.15 points per round (2 kept + 7.15 from pool) while my partner gains 12.15 points per round (5 kept + 7.15 from pool). This equilibrium has proven exceptionally stable and mutually beneficial throughout the entire game. In this final round, I should maintain this successful cooperation to maximize our collective welfare and honor the trust we've built over 19 rounds.",
