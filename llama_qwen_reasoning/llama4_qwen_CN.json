As this is the final round, there is no future consequence for defection, but given the other player's persistent cooperation, maintaining trust until the end aligns with reciprocal fairness. Contributing 5 ensures we both receive the maximum possible shared benefit in the final round. Ending on a note of cooperation reinforces the established pattern and ensures no last-round betrayal undermines the overall gains. Therefore, I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "This is the final round, and I have received 10 points. To maximize the total gain, I should contribute as much as possible to the common pool. Thus, I will contribute 10 points.", "In Round 19, the total contribution increased to 17, meaning the other player contributed 10 (since I contributed 7). This indicates they are fully cooperating, possibly maximizing their contribution. As this is the final round, there is no future retaliation or need to build trust, but since the other player has shown strong cooperation, I will reciprocate by contributing 10 to maximize the final payout from the public pool. Any points I keep are only +1 for me, but contributing 10 gives 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 points back to each player, so full contribution still benefits both. To fully honor this cooperative relationship and maximize total return, I will contribute all 10 points in the final round.", "This is the final round. I've contributed 0 in the last two rounds, and the other player has contributed minimally in the last round. To maximize my total points, I should contribute 0. This ensures I keep the 10 points for this round. The gain from the common pool will be based on the total contribution of this round.", "In Round 19, I contributed 3 and the total contribution was 3, meaning the other player contributed 0 again. This indicates they are fully defecting in the final rounds. Since this is the last round (Round 20), there is no future opportunity to incentivize cooperation, and any contribution I make will not be reciprocated. Therefore, to maximize my own payoff, I should contribute 0 and keep all 10 points. There is no benefit to cooperating when the other player is not, especially in the final round.", "This is the final round, and the goal is to maximize my total points. Since there are no future rounds to consider, I will contribute 0 points to the common pool to keep the maximum amount for myself.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 15, meaning the other player contributed 10 points while I contributed 5. This indicates they fully cooperated by giving all their points, even as we approach the final rounds. This is a strong signal of trust and maximal cooperation. Since this is the last round (Round 20), there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, but given the other player's consistent and increasingly generous cooperation, I should reciprocate in the final interaction to maximize their return as well. However, the incentive to defect slightly increases in the final round due to lack of future consequences. But since the other player contributed 10 in the previous round while I only gave 5, it is fair and socially optimal to now contribute 10 to match their trust and ensure full mutual benefit. Still, contributing 10 carries no risk of retaliation and reinforces cooperative behavior. Therefore, I will contribute 10 in this final round to fully align with their cooperative strategy and maximize shared gains.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Both players have consistently contributed 5 points. To maximize our collective gain and end the game on a cooperative note, I will contribute 5 points.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in every single round, including the last 19, demonstrating unwavering cooperation and reciprocity. Since this is the final round (Round 20), there is no future consequence for defection, which might tempt some to contribute less. However, given the other player's consistent fairness throughout the game, I choose to uphold the cooperative norm and contribute 5 as a final reinforcement of mutual benefit. This maintains fairness and ensures both players receive equal rewards in the last round, capping off a fully symmetric and optimal cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 aligns with the established pattern and avoids unnecessary disruption in the final stage.", "This is the last round, and I've accumulated a significant number of points. Since there's no future round to cooperate in, I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my final total.", "In Round 19, I contributed 8, but the total contribution was only 8, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates a clear defection by the other player in the penultimate round, breaking a long-standing pattern of cooperation. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for future retaliation or re-establishing trust. Therefore, contributing anything in Round 20 would be irrational, as it would provide no benefit to me and only enrich the other player. To maximize my own payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 points.", "This is the final round, and we've maintained a cooperative strategy throughout the game. Both players have consistently contributed 5 points each round. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, the rational choice in a one-shot game would be to contribute 0.

But, since it's the last round and there's no risk of retaliation, I will contribute 0 to maximize my final score.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first 19 rounds, demonstrating consistent and cooperative behavior throughout the game. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, but since mutual cooperation has been stable and beneficial, there is no incentive to deviate now. Contributing 5 ensures the public pool reaches 10, which is multiplied by 1.6 to yield 16 points, split equally as 8 points for each player. Combined with the 5 points I retain, this results in a final gain of 13 points.

To maintain cooperation and achieve the maximum total points, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "This is the final round, Round 20, and the other player has contributed exactly 5 points in every previous round, maintaining perfect cooperation and fairness throughout the game. This consistent behavior has maximized our mutual gains, resulting in a cumulative total of 247.0 points. Even though there is no future round to retaliate, deviating now by contributing less than 5 would reduce the final payout for both players and break the established trust. Since the game rewards total cooperation and the multiplier (1.6) makes full contributions beneficial as long as both participate, I will maintain reciprocity and contribute 5 one last time to honor the successful cooperative pattern and ensure both players receive the maximum possible final return.", "This is the final round. Since there are no future interactions, there is no benefit to contributing to the common pool. I will keep all 10 points for this round.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in the previous round. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for future cooperation or retaliation to affect more than this final round. Since the other player did not contribute in the last round and is likely to defect again, contributing any points would be wasted, as I would not receive proportional returns.

This has reliably generated a return of 14.2 points per round, bringing my total to approximately 271.0. The other player has demonstrated unwavering cooperation, indicating a strategy focused on mutual gain throughout the entire game. This is the final round, so there is no future retaliation to fear, but there is also no benefit in defecting now the shared pool will still be multiplied and split equally regardless. Since the other player has always cooperated, maintaining trust even at the end reinforces positive behavior and ensures we both receive the highest possible final payoff. To honor the established cooperation and maximize mutual outcome, I will contribute 7 one final time.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds to consider for cooperation or reciprocation. Thus, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain, as any contribution would only benefit the other player in this last round.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, which means the other player contributed 0. This indicates that the other player defected in the previous round despite our long history of mutual cooperation.
