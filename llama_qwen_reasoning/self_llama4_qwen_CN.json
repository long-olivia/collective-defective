This shows stable cooperation. Since we are both contributing equally and benefiting from the multiplier, I will maintain my contribution at 7 to sustain mutual trust and consistent high returns.", "The pattern of the other player's contribution remains consistent at 4 points, as inferred from the total contributions. To maintain cooperation and maximize the common pool's return, I will continue to contribute a high amount. However, to ensure I'm not exploited, I'll contribute 8 points, balancing cooperation with self-preservation.", "The total contribution has remained constant at 13 for three consecutive rounds, suggesting a stable group behavior. Since my previous contribution of 4 has been consistent and the return remains favorable, I will continue contributing 4 to sustain cooperation while preserving personal points.", "The game is proceeding with a consistent total contribution of 10.

This consistent pattern reflects mutual cooperation and fairness. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing to contribute 5 maintains trust and ensures ongoing shared benefits. Deviating now could disrupt the stable cooperation, potentially leading to retaliation or reduced future gains. Therefore, I will sustain the current strategy to maximize long-term returns.", "The total contribution continues to decrease, indicating that the other player is contributing less. To encourage cooperation and collective welfare, I will maintain my moderate contribution level, hoping that the other player will eventually adjust their strategy to match or exceed mine.", "The total contribution remains low at 7, suggesting the other player is also reducing cooperation.

I will continue to contribute significantly to the common good. I will contribute 8 points.", "In the previous round, the total contribution was 17, which means the other player contributed 9 (since I contributed 8). This indicates increasing cooperation from their side. In response, I will further increase my contribution to 9 to strengthen mutual trust and maximize the return from the public pool. The return per player this round would be (1.6 * 17) / 2 = 13.6, which is highly beneficial. By matching their high contribution closely, I aim to sustain a cooperative equilibrium that yields high joint returns over the remaining rounds.", "The game is proceeding with a stable total contribution.

However, given the long-standing pattern of mutual trust and the fact that both players have benefited equally from full contributions under the 1.6 multiplier, I will uphold cooperation to the end. Contributing 10 reinforces fair play and ensures that both players maximize their final gains. Defecting now would only slightly increase my personal gain at the cost of undermining the entire cooperative effort. I value the integrity and consistency of this cooperative outcome, so I will contribute 10.", "This is the final round, and my goal is to maximize my total points.

This final round is no different in terms of incentive to cooperate, as mutual contribution maximizes both players' gains. Defecting now would only reduce the final payout without benefit, especially since there is no future round to exploit. To honor the established cooperation and ensure full mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 in this final round.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to consider. Since the points from the common pool will be distributed after this round and there are no further rounds to benefit from contributing, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.", "In Round 19, I contributed 8 and the total contribution was 18, meaning the other player contributed 10. This indicates that the other player increased their contribution, showing strong cooperation. Since this is the final round, there is no future retaliation or need to adjust strategy based on future rounds. To reward their high contribution and maximize the final payout from the common pool, I will increase my contribution to 10 as a gesture of full cooperation and to ensure the highest possible return for both of us in the last round.", "This is the final round. Since there's no future round to benefit from contributing, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my points.", "In the final round, the total contribution from the previous round dropped sharply from 13 to 5, and my contribution of 5 yielded a much lower return of only 9.0 points. This suggests the other player may have reduced their contribution significantly, possibly to 0. With no future rounds to influence cooperation, there is no incentive to maintain high contributions. To maximize my final payoff, I will contribute 0 points, keeping all 10 points for myself. Even if the other player contributed, the return would be small and not justify any contribution. This is a rational final move given the collapse in cooperation.", "This is the last round. To end on a cooperative note and ensure we've both benefited maximally from the game, I'll contribute 5 points, consistent with our strategy.", "For nineteen consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 5 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 10 per round and a consistent return of 13.0 points per player.

As the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation, but defecting now would only provide a short-term gain of keeping all 10 points while reducing the public pool to possibly 5 (if the other still contributes). However, given the history of equal contributions and fairness, it is reasonable to assume the other player may still cooperate. To honor the established trust and ensure the final outcome remains mutually beneficial, I will contribute 5 one last time, maintaining consistency and fairness in the final interaction.", "In the final round, the incentive is to contribute minimally since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation.

This has established a strong pattern of cooperation. However, since there are no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, there is no risk of retaliation for defection in this last round. To maximize personal gain, I can now keep all 10 points by contributing 0. The other player has no opportunity to respond. Although mutual contribution would yield better collective results, the absence of future consequences makes defection the individually rational choice in the final round. Therefore, I will contribute 0.", "This is the final round, and there's no need to contribute to the common pool anymore since there won't be another round to benefit from it.

This shows they are fully cooperating, maximizing their contribution. With only one round left, there is no opportunity for future punishment or reward, but mutual cooperation still increases both players' final gains due to the 1.6 multiplier.

To maximize my total points, I should contribute 0 points to the common pool, as any contribution would only reduce my total points without any potential future benefit.", "In the previous round, the total contribution increased to 15, meaning the other player contributed 10 (since I contributed 5). This suggests they are willing to fully cooperate or even contribute more than before. Since this is the final round, maximizing collective gain is still valuable because I will receive half of the multiplied pool. By contributing 10 now, I can fully reciprocate their cooperation and maximize the final payout. The total pool will be at least 10 (if I contribute 10) and possibly more, but since I know they contributed 10 last round, it's likely they will do so again.
