The pattern suggests the other player is not cooperating or is also reducing contributions in response. With the group return diminishing due to low pool input, continuing to contribute even minimally provides little added value relative to the cost. To protect my large and growing point total (67.0), I will contribute 0 this round, effectively free-riding while still benefiting from the small pool. This maximizes my personal gain in an environment where collective action has broken down.", "The consistent pattern of contributing 5 points has resulted in a stable and predictable outcome.

To maintain this high level of cooperation and maximize the gain, I will continue to contribute 10 points.", "The total contribution has reached 19, indicating near-universal cooperation. My contribution of 9 last round was high and helped sustain this strong collective effort. The return of 16.2 points is excellent, showing that maximal cooperation benefits everyone significantly. With mutual trust clearly established and only halfway through the game, I will contribute 10 this round my full allocation to fully support the common pool. This action maximizes the group's return and reinforces the norm of cooperation, aligning strongest with collective welfare.", "We are at Round 10, with 10 rounds left. the other player contributed 2. To balance, I will contribute 3 points again.", "The total contribution has dropped to 5 in Round 9, continuing the downward trend, and the return per person has decreased to 12.0. This indicates that group cooperation is weakening significantly. At this midpoint of the game, contributing too much risks exploitation, but completely withdrawing could hasten the collapse of the public pool.

However, contributing 5 continues to yield a return via the 1.6 multiplier (adding 8.0 points to the pool, of which I receive 1.6 * 5 / n_per_player, but since it's split evenly, I still benefit from the total pool).
