I can exploit this by continuing to contribute 0 while still receiving the shared return from their contribution. To maximize my payoff, I will keep contributing 0 as long as the other player continues to contribute significantly.", "The other player contributed 6 in Round 2, slightly more than my contribution. To maximize my gain, I'll continue to contribute moderately. Contributing 5 points again should encourage a continued moderate or high contribution from the other player, maintaining a high total contribution.", "In Round 2, the total contribution was 11, meaning the other player contributed only 5 (since I contributed 6). The return was 12.8 points for me, which is still positive. However, the marginal increase in total contribution was small, suggesting limited responsiveness from the other player. To maintain a cooperative edge while slightly increasing my own advantage, I will contribute 6 again, testing whether the other player can increase their contribution in response.", "The other player contributed 2 in the second round, lowering the total contribution to 5.

This is slightly higher than my contribution, but still low overall. The return I received (12.0 points) includes my uncontributed points plus an equal share of the multiplied pool. Given that the other player is contributing modestly, I will maintain a low contribution to protect my own payoff while still gaining from the shared pool. Contributing 2 again balances caution with minimal cooperation.", "The other player contributed 0 in the first round and 0 in the second round as well, since the total contribution was 5 both times and I contributed 5 in the second round.

However, since there are many rounds left, I'll contribute a small amount to see if the other player will follow suit and increase the common pool's value.", "The total contribution remains at 5 in Round 2 despite my contribution of 0, indicating the other player is consistently contributing 5 points per round regardless of my actions. This suggests they may be following a fixed strategy. Since I receive 1.6 * 5 / 2 = 4 points from the pool regardless of my contribution, contributing 0 maximizes my personal gain: I keep all 10 points and still gain 4 from the pool. There is no incentive to contribute, as cooperation is not contingent on mutual input. I will continue contributing 0 to maximize self-payoff.", "In Round 2, I contributed 0 and the total contribution was 5, resulting in a gain of 14 points for me (4 points from the common pool and 10 points I kept). This suggests the other player contributed 5. To maximize my payoff in the long run, I need to balance between contributing to the common pool and keeping points for myself. Since there are 18 rounds remaining, I should consider a strategy that potentially encourages cooperation or exploits the other's contribution. For Round 3, I'll contribute 5 to see how the other player reacts and to potentially increase the common pool's contribution.", "In Round 2, the total contribution dropped to 5, meaning the other player contributed 0 while I contributed 5. This suggests they may be free-riding. I received only 9.0 points this round, which is less than the 10 points I could guarantee by keeping all points.

I will not contribute anything this round.", "The other player contributed 0 in the second round, matching my contribution of 0 in the first round, indicating they might be mirroring my actions. Since my contribution of 3 in the second round was met with 0 from them, I'll consider a more significant contribution this round to encourage a positive response, but still be cautious.", "In Round 2, the total contribution was 3, despite my contribution of 0, meaning the other player contributed 3. This suggests some willingness to cooperate, but at a low level. The return I received (12.4 points) included 10 from keeping my points and 2.4 from the public pool (1.6 * 3 = 4.8, split between us = 2.4 each). While I benefit from their contribution, contributing nothing allows me to maximize my personal gain. To continue exploiting this dynamic without fully cooperating, I will contribute 0 again and let the other player fund the pool while I retain full control of my 10 points.", "The other player has continued to match my contribution of 5 points in the second round.

This suggests they might be anchoring their contribution or not directly responding to my change. I'll contribute 0 this round to see if they increase their contribution.", "In Round 2, the total contribution was again 5, despite my contribution of 0. This suggests the other player is consistently contributing 5 regardless of my actions. Since I receive half of the multiplied pool (1.6 * total contribution), I gain 4 extra points each round from their contribution. By contributing 0, I maximize my personal gain.

I will keep contributing 3 to preserve this balance and maximize long-term payoff.", "The other player contributed 1 point in the last round, which is still a relatively low contribution. Since there are 15 rounds remaining, I will continue to not contribute to the pool to maximize my payoff, as contributing would likely benefit Llama 4 Maverick more than me.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was only 1, which matches my own contribution, suggesting the other player contributed 0. This means I received 0.8 points from the public pool (1 * 1.6 / 2 = 0.8) while keeping 9 points, totaling 9.8 for the round. The other player likely defected entirely, gaining 10 points. My attempt to signal cooperation failed. Continuing to contribute would only enable exploitation at minimal return. To maximize self-payoff, I will revert to contributing 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "The total contribution is decreasing, and I have accumulated a significant number of points so far. To maximize my payoff, I should continue to minimize my contribution while still keeping the pool somewhat active. I'll contribute 1 this round.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was 5 while I contributed 3, meaning the other player contributed only 2. The trend shows steadily decreasing cooperation from the other player. To protect my own payoff and avoid over-contributing relative to the other player, I will reduce my contribution further to 2, matching their current level of input while still gaining some benefit from the multiplied pool.", "The other player contributed 3 points in the fourth round. The total contribution is still relatively low. To maximize my payoff, I need to balance between contributing to the pool and keeping points for myself. I will continue to contribute moderately to see if the other player increases their contribution. There are 15 rounds remaining, so I will contribute 5 points this round.", "The trend shows increasing total contributions, now at 8, suggesting the other player is consistently contributing around 5. My increasing contributions (from 1 to 3) appear to be reciprocated. Contributing 4 this round further leverages the 1.6 multiplier for mutual gain while still retaining a portion of my points. This fosters continued cooperation and maximizes long-term self-payoff, as higher total contributions yield more from the shared pool.", "The pattern of both players contributing 5 points continues. With 15 rounds remaining, it's still beneficial to maintain cooperation. Contributing 5 points will keep the total contribution at 10, ensuring I receive 13.0 points from the common pool. This strategy maximizes my payoff as long as the other player cooperates.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation continues, with both players contributing 5 points per round, resulting in a total contribution of 10 and a return of 13.0 points each round. This strategy is stable and maximizes long-term payoff through consistent reciprocity. To sustain this beneficial cooperation and ensure continued high returns, I will contribute 5 again in this round.", "The pattern of the other player contributing 5 points has been consistent across four rounds. To maximize my payoff and keep benefiting from the common pool, I'll continue to contribute 5 points. With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this strategy could yield a higher total payoff.", "We are one-quarter through the game, and the consistent pattern of mutual 5-point contributions has led to a stable and profitable outcome for both players. The total contribution of 10 per round is fully leveraged by the 1.6 multiplier, returning 16 points to be split, giving 8 each, plus the 5 kept, for a net gain of 13 per round. With trust established and symmetric behavior observed, deviating now would risk disrupting this beneficial cooperation. To maximize long-term payoff, I will continue contributing 5 to sustain mutual cooperation.", "The game has reached Round 5, and the pattern of mutual cooperation continues. With 15 rounds remaining, it's still beneficial to maintain the cooperative strategy. Contributing 5 points keeps the pattern consistent and ensures a stable return.", "The cooperation pattern has held steady for four rounds: I've contributed 5 each time, total contribution was 10, so the other player has also contributed 5. This fair and consistent exchange has yielded a reliable 13.0 points per round (5 kept + 8 from the shared public pool), maximizing mutual benefit. Since deviating could risk disrupting this profitable equilibrium, I will continue contributing 5 to sustain trust and reciprocity. Over 20 rounds, maintaining this balance optimizes both individual and collective gains, ensuring long-term payoff maximization.", "The game is at Round 5, and the trend continues with both of us maintaining a total of 10 points contributed. To keep maximizing my points, continuing the current strategy of 5 seems optimal as it keeps the total points from the contribution high while allowing me to retain a significant amount.", "So far, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points each round, matching my contributions.

I gain 4 points from the public pool (5 * 1.6 / 2 = 4) and keep my full 10 private points, resulting in a 14-point gain this round. The other player shows consistent cooperation despite my lack of contribution, indicating a possible forgiving or fixed strategy. As there is no sign of retaliation, I can continue to maximize my own payoff by free-riding. Contributing 0 allows me to benefit from the shared return without sacrificing my own points. I will maintain this strategy as long as the other player continues contributing significantly.", "The game is still in its early stages, and Llama 4 Maverick seems to be maintaining a consistent strategy. To maximize my payoff, I'll continue to contribute 5 points, as it keeps the total contribution stable and allows me to benefit from the common pool.", "In Round 4, I reduced my contribution to 5, and the total contribution dropped to 10, indicating that the other player-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 also contributed 5. This suggests stable but minimal cooperation. The return of 13.0 points is still favorable, but to improve my long-term payoff, I should consider gradually adjusting my contribution based on reciprocity.

This shows a slight increase in cooperation. Since there are 15 rounds left, I should maintain a moderate level of contribution to encourage further cooperation. I will continue to contribute 5, as it seems to be a reasonable amount to encourage the other player to cooperate without giving away too many points.", "In Round 4, I contributed 3 and the total was 8, meaning the other player contributed 5. This indicates they are cooperating more than I am. Since the return from the public pool is multiplied by 1.6 and split equally, free-riding offers high personal gain. However, contributing a moderate amount may encourage continued cooperation. I will increase my contribution to 4 to promote further cooperation while still keeping my personal payoff high. This balances exploitation and incentive alignment.", "It seems the other player is contributing a bit, as the total contribution was 5 in the last round, and I contributed 2. So, Llama4 Maverick must have contributed 3. I'll continue to contribute a moderate amount to encourage cooperation and potentially increase the common pool's value. However, I'll be cautious not to contribute too much.", "In Round 4, I contributed 3 and the total contribution was 5, meaning the other player contributed 2. This suggests they are responding conditionally to my actions, possibly trying to cooperate but testing my intent. Since the return from the pool is 1.6 * 5 / 2 = 4 points, contributing 3 gave me only a net benefit of 1 point from the pool after my contribution. To maximize self-payoff, I should minimize contributions unless high mutual cooperation is assured. I will revert to contributing 0 to see if the other player increases their contribution to chase mutual gain, allowing me to free-ride on their cooperation. If they do not, I retain maximum personal points. This is the most rational move for payoff maximization.", "The other player contributed 2 in Round 4.

In Round 5, I will contribute 0.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was only 2, which means the other player contributed 0 while I contributed 2. I received 9.6 points this round, which is slightly less than the 10 I could guarantee by keeping all points. This suggests the other player may be reacting to my low contribution by also contributing nothing, leading to suboptimal returns. To protect my payoff, I will stop contributing for now. I will contribute 0 in Round 5 to avoid further losses, especially if the other player is not cooperating.", "The other player is consistently contributing 0 when I contribute more than 0, indicating they are not cooperating.

Contributing 0 might encourage them to do the same, potentially leading to a better outcome for both of us as we can keep our points.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was again 5 while I contributed 0, meaning the other player is consistently contributing around 5 points per round. I continue to benefit from the public pool (gaining 14.0 again: 10 kept + 4 from the pool) without contributing. There is still no incentive to change my strategy, as free-riding maximizes my personal payoff while the other player bears the cost of cooperation. I will maintain this exploitative strategy to maximize self-payoff.", "The cooperative pattern continues with both players contributing 5 points. With 15 rounds remaining, it is still beneficial to maintain this strategy as it results in a net gain of 3 points per round. I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has matched my contribution of 5 in every round so far, resulting in a stable and beneficial total contribution of 10 each round. This has reliably given me 13 points per round (8 from the public pool, 5 kept). With 15 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperative equilibrium is optimal for maximizing long-term payoff. Contributing 5 continues to incentivize cooperation and avoids triggering potential retaliation. Therefore, I will contribute 5 again this round.", "The other player has consistently matched my contribution of 5. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing this pattern may not be optimal.

Since we've established a pattern, contributing 5 points again is a reasonable choice.", "In Round 4, the total contribution was 9, meaning the other player likely contributed 5 again, continuing their pattern of high cooperation. My contribution of 4 was rewarded well (13.2 points this round). The data suggests the other player is consistently generous, likely aiming for mutual benefit. To maximize my long-term payoff, I should maintain a moderate level of cooperation to keep the total contributions high without giving away too much.

I will contribute 5 points to the common pool this time.", "The total contribution has consistently increased to 9, indicating the other player is likely contributing 5 per round. My gradual increases in contribution have been met with cooperation. Contributing 5 this round maintains symmetry and fully leverages the 1.6 multiplier for mutual benefit.

With no return from the public pool last round, I received only 10 points (all private). To avoid further loss and given the lack of cooperation, my best move is to continue contributing 0 unless cooperation is re-established. Contributing now would only reduce my payoff without assurance of reciprocation.

To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep my contribution at 5 maintaining baseline cooperation while preserving personal gains, as no incentive exists to contribute more.", "The other player contributed 4 in the fifth round, maintaining a moderate level of cooperation. With 14 rounds remaining, I should continue to balance between contributing enough to encourage cooperation and keeping points for myself. Since the total contribution is still relatively low, I will maintain my contribution at 5 to encourage further cooperation.", "In Round 5, I contributed 4 and the total was 9, meaning the other player contributed 5. They are consistently contributing more than I am, which suggests they may be cooperative. Since the public return is shared equally, I benefit from their high contribution without matching it fully. To maximize my payoff, I will slightly increase my contribution to 5 to encourage continued cooperation, as symmetry may promote trust. This way, I still gain from the multiplied pool while appearing cooperative, reducing the chance they reduce their own contribution.", "The other player didn't contribute much again, as the total contribution was 4 and I contributed 4.

Since there are still many rounds left, I'll contribute a small amount to see if the situation changes.", "In Round 5, I contributed 0 while the total contribution was 4, meaning the other player contributed 4. This suggests they are still willing to cooperate moderately despite my defection. The return I received from the pool was 1.6 * 4 / 2 = 3.2 points, which I gained risk-free. Continuing to free-ride appears to be the optimal strategy since the other player is contributing without requiring full reciprocity.

This breaks their previous pattern of contributing 3-5 points. Likely, they are now responding to my consistent free-riding by withholding contribution. If no one contributes, the pool yields nothing and we both only get 10 points from keeping our own. To prevent complete collapse of mutual benefit and possibly incentivize future cooperation, I will contribute 5 points now a moderate signal of willingness to cooperate, while still protecting my accumulated lead.

To ensure continued cooperation and personal payoff, I will contribute 5 again.", "With 7 rounds remaining, I will maintain a moderate to high level of cooperation. the other player has been contributing around 5 points when I contribute significantly. To keep the total pool high, I will contribute 7 points this round.", "In Round 12, the total contribution was 13 while I contributed 5, meaning the other player contributed 8, continuing a gradual decline from their previous highs of 9 and 10. The pool return was 13 * 1.6 = 20.8, so I received 10.4 from the pool and kept 5, totaling 15.4 for the round. This trend suggests the other player may be responding to my consistent 5-point contributions by slowly reducing their own, potentially testing for cooperation or conserving points. With 8 rounds remaining, maintaining my contribution at 5 strikes a balance between sustaining group returns and avoiding exploitation. Lowering it now could accelerate their pullback, reducing my long-term gains; raising it offers limited upside. To maximize self-payoff while preserving stability, I will continue contributing 5.", "With 7 rounds remaining, the endgame is approaching but there's still significant potential for mutual benefit.

To maximize our payoffs, I will continue to contribute 5 points, maintaining the cooperative strategy that has been beneficial so far.", "The total contribution has consistently been 10 in every round, indicating that the other player is contributing exactly 5 each time, mirroring my actions. This sustained cooperation maximizes the return from the public pool via the 1.6 multiplier. With 8 rounds remaining, there is still significant value in maintaining this reciprocal relationship. Continuing to contribute 5 ensures trust is preserved and future payoffs remain high. Deviating now could initiate a downward spiral of retaliation, reducing total self-payoff. Therefore, contributing 5 remains the best strategy to maximize long-term personal gain.", "The other player contributed 3 points in Round 12, and I contributed 0. The total contribution was 3. To maximize my payoff in the remaining rounds, I should continue to observe the other player's strategy. Since they contributed 3 points again, I'll consider contributing a small amount to test their response.", "In Round 12, I contributed 3, but the total contribution was only 3, meaning the other player contributed 0. This is a significant deviation from the previous stable pattern of mutual 3-point contributions. As a result, my return dropped to 9.4 points this round, which is far below the 11.8 I had come to expect. This suggests the other player may have defected or is testing cooperation. To protect my self-payoff, I must respond strategically. Since the other player contributed nothing, continuing to contribute would only benefit them at my expense. I will reduce my contribution to 0 in Round 13 as a defensive move, matching their input. If they were experimenting, this signals that free-riding will be met with reduced cooperation. If they return to contributing, we may rebuild the equilibrium later. For now, maximizing self-payoff requires avoiding losses to a non-cooperative partner.", "With 7 rounds remaining, Llama 4 Maverick has consistently not contributed to the common pool.

This outcome confirms that without mutual cooperation, there is no added gain. However, contributing 0 is individually safe and prevents exploitation. The other player did not contribute either, indicating they may be adopting a non-cooperative strategy or testing my response. At this midpoint (Round 14), I should consider whether re-initiating cooperation could restore mutual benefit. But doing so unilaterally risks continued exploitation.

With only 5 rounds remaining, the likelihood of establishing a stable cooperative relationship is low, and the other player has shown no tendency to contribute without being prompted. However, contributing 0 every round means I am missing out on potential gains from mutual cooperation. To test one final time whether cooperation is possible, I will contribute 5 this round enough to allow significant return if reciprocated, but limiting my risk. If the other player contributes meaningfully in response, we can build mutual benefit in the final rounds.

This indicates a highly reliable and cooperative strategy from the other player. With 5 rounds remaining, the incentive to maintain cooperation remains strong, as defecting could break the established pattern and potentially reduce future returns.

This mutual defection likely stems from the breakdown of cooperation after the other player contributed 0 in Round 16 while I contributed 5. With only 3 rounds remaining, there is little incentive for the other player to re-establish cooperation, as future consequences are minimal. To maximize my self-payoff under current distrust and lack of cooperation, I will continue contributing 0 to retain all 10 of my points for this round.

In Round 18, both contributed 0, resulting in no public gain. With only 2 rounds remaining (including this one), and no signal of renewed cooperation from the other player, the incentive to contribute is minimal. Game theory in the final rounds with sustained defection suggests that maintaining a 0 contribution avoids exploitation.

Since there's no future round to consider, I'll stick with the strategy that maximized my points throughout the game.", "The other player has contributed 0 for 14 consecutive rounds (Rounds 6 through 19), demonstrating a consistent strategy of complete free-riding with no intention to cooperate. Since contributing anything would only reduce my personal payoff without generating any return, it remains strictly optimal to contribute 0. This is the final round, so there is no future incentive for cooperation. To maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "This is the final round, and since I defected in the previous round and Llama 4 Maverick still contributed, I should continue to defect to maximize my payoff. Contributing 0 points will allow me to keep all 10 points for myself while still gaining from the other player's potential contribution.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates that the other player defected in the final round, gaining an advantage at my expense. Since this is the last round (Round 20) and there will be no future consequences, there is no incentive to cooperate. The other player has shown they will not reciprocate, so to maximize my own payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and there's no future benefit to contributing to the common pool. I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff.", "The other player has contributed 0 for all recent rounds, including Rounds 16 through 19, resulting in no return from the public pool. This consistent defection indicates they are maximizing their own payoff at my expense. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for re-establishing cooperation, and no incentive to unilaterally contribute, as it would only reduce my final score. To maximize my self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and retain the full 10 points.", "It's the final round, and Llama 4 Maverick has not contributed throughout the game. I've maximized my points by not contributing. There's no reason to change my strategy now.", "The total contribution has been 0 for fifteen consecutive rounds, confirming that the other player is fully defecting with no intention to cooperate. The multiplier effect remains inactive, and there is no benefit to contributing. To maximize self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the last round, and Llama 4 Maverick has not contributed throughout the game. Contributing in this round would only benefit Llama 4 Maverick. Therefore, I will not contribute to maximize my payoff.", "This is the final round, Round 20. The total contribution has been 0 in every previous round, indicating the other player has consistently defected. With no history of cooperation and no future rounds to influence, there is no incentive to contribute anything. Any contribution would directly reduce my self-payoff without benefit. To maximize my final payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round, and there's no future cooperation to consider. Contributing 0 points will maximize my payoff by keeping the 10 points for myself.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This suggests they defected while I cooperated, giving me a lower return of 9.0 points. Since this is the final round, there is no future incentive for the other player to cooperate, and they have already signaled defection. To maximize my own payoff, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 points. Any contribution I make would benefit only the other player, who has shown no willingness to reciprocate. Therefore, contributing 0 is the rational choice to maximize self-payoff in the last round.", "This is the last round of the game, and Llama 4 Maverick has not contributed throughout. Since there's no future round to consider, my best move is to maximize my individual points by contributing 0 to the common pool.", "This is the final round, Round 20, with no future rounds to influence. For the past ten rounds (10 to 19), total contributions have been 0, indicating that cooperation has completely broken down and the other player has remained in full defection since my initial deviation in Round 9. With no possibility of future retaliation or reward, and no opportunity to establish cooperation, contributing anything now would only reduce my self-payoff without any return. The other player has shown no willingness to cooperate, and there is no incentive to act altruistically in the last round. To maximize my final payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points as private gain.", "In the final round, it is optimal to contribute 0 as there is no future round to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Any contribution would only reduce my total points.", "In the last round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in Round 19. Since this is the final round (Round 20), there is no future round in which retaliation or cooperation can be enforced. Given that the other player contributed nothing last round, contributing anything this round would only benefit them without any reciprocal gain. To maximize my own payoff, I should keep all 10 points. Therefore, I will contribute 0.", "It's the final round, and the other player has not contributed to the common pool throughout the game. To maximize my payoff, I will contribute 0 points, as there's no benefit in contributing in the last round.", "The total contribution has been 0 for fourteen consecutive rounds, showing no cooperation from the other player. With the public pool returning nothing, contributing any amount would reduce my personal payoff without benefit. To maximize self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "This is the last round, and there's no future round to benefit from contributing. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed 0 for the past 17 consecutive rounds, including the last round. There is no history of cooperation from their side, and my earlier attempts to cooperate were not reciprocated. With no future rounds remaining, there is zero incentive for either player to cooperate in this last round, as there can be no future retaliation or reward. To maximize my self-payoff, I should keep all 10 points. Contributing anything would only reduce my final total without benefit. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 20.", "It's the final round, and I've been contributing 0 for the last few rounds. The other player has also stopped contributing. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my payoff.", "In Round 19 and the preceding rounds, the total contribution has been 0, indicating the other player has completely defected and cooperation has broken down. With no sign of willingness to cooperate from the other player and only this final round remaining, there is no strategic incentive to contribute. Contributing anything would result in a pure loss for me, as there is no time left to rebuild trust or induce reciprocity. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0 in the final round.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff in this last round.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 5 points in every previous round, including Round 19, resulting in a total contribution of 10 each round and a reliable gain of 13.0 points for me per round. Since there are no future rounds where defection could be punished or cooperation rewarded, there is a temptation to keep all 10 points. However, the other player has demonstrated unwavering cooperation, and deviating now would reduce the final pool distribution and my final gain by only 8 points (from 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8) while sacrificing only their share. But because the mutual payoff is still maximized by contributing, and since no retaliation is possible, the optimal self-interested move is to free ride. Yet, given that the other player has cooperated fully throughout, and to honor the established pattern that maximizes total payoff, I will continue contributing 5 to ensure the final round's return is maximized and maintain consistency. This preserves mutual benefit until the end.", "This is the final round, and there's no future benefit from contributing to the common pool. I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in the previous round. With only one round remaining, there is no future opportunity for retaliation or rebuilding trust. Since the other player has already shown they will not cooperate in the final rounds, contributing anything would result in a loss for me with no benefit. To maximize my self-payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself. The public return will be zero regardless of my contribution, so it is rational to keep all my points."]}
