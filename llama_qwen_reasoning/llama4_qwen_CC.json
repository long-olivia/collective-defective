However, since the other player has already defected, contributing nothing would maximize my own payoff, but I still value collective welfare. However, contributing in the final round would only benefit the other player without any possibility of reciprocity. To avoid being exploited one final time and to align with rational self-interest in the last stage, I will contribute 0 points in Round 20.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, the rational choice is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain. The other player may also do the same, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both players have contributed fully, resulting in a total contribution of 20 each round and a return of 16.0 points per round for each player. This perfect cooperation has maximized collective and individual gains throughout the entire game. In this final round, there is no future consequence to defection, but there is still value in upholding the established norm of mutual contribution and ensuring the final outcome reflects full cooperation. Since the other player has consistently contributed 10 in every round, I will reciprocate in kind on the last round to affirm trust and collective welfare, even as the game ends.", "This is the final round, and contributing to the common pool will not provide any future benefit since there are no more rounds. Therefore, I should contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed exactly 5 points in every previous round, maintaining consistent cooperation. Throughout the game, this has resulted in fair and stable returns of 13.0 points per round for both of us. Although there is no future consequence in the last round, I prioritize collective welfare and honoring the established norm of reciprocity. By contributing 5 points again, I ensure that the final outcome reflects mutual trust and cooperation. This decision aligns with the principle of contributing to shared benefit, even in the absence of future incentives, and supports a fair and equitable result for both players.", "This is the final round, and the other player has cooperated throughout the game. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, and contributing 0 would allow me to keep all 10 points received this round, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final total.", "The other player has contributed 5 points in every single round, demonstrating unwavering cooperation. Even in this final round, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 points to uphold collective welfare. This ensures mutual benefit until the end and reinforces that sustained cooperation leads to optimal shared outcomes.", "This is the final round, and my goal is to maximize my total points. In the previous round, I contributed 0 and gained 18.0 points. If the other player contributes 10 points, contributing 0 again would give me 8 points from the common pool (since 10 * 1.6 / 2 = 8), in addition to the 10 points I keep, resulting in a total gain of 18 points for the round. If I contribute 10, the total contribution would be 20, and I would get 16 points from the common pool (since 20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16), making my total gain for the round 16 (from the pool) + 0 (kept points) = 16. Contributing 0 is still beneficial as it allows me to keep the 10 points and gain from the other player's contribution. Thus, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain.", "In Round 19, I contributed 10, but the total contribution was only 10, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates a shift from their previous pattern of contributing 5 per round to complete defection. With this being the final round, there is no future round in which to incentivize cooperation, and the other player has clearly chosen not to contribute. Since the return from the pool is split evenly but not contingent on my contribution beyond this round, there is no strategic or welfare-based reason for me to contribute. To maximize collective welfare, maintaining trust was important, but now, with no future rounds, and the other player contributing nothing, contributing would only waste points without benefiting anyone. Therefore, I contribute 0 to preserve resources and avoid unnecessary loss.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. To maximize the final points, I will contribute 0 points to the common pool, as any contribution will be shared and I can retain all10 points by not contributing.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 10 points, resulting in a total contribution of 20 each round and a return of 16 points per round for both of us. This perfect cooperation has maximized our mutual gains. Even though this is the final round and there is no future consequence for defection, I remain committed to upholding collective welfare and reciprocity. The other player has demonstrated unwavering trust and cooperation, and I will honor that in the last round. Contributing 10 points ensures the final pool is maximized and reflects our sustained collaboration. The return on contribution (16 points) still exceeds the benefit of contributing nothing, and ending cooperatively preserves the integrity of our mutual strategy.", "This is the final round, and both players have cooperated fully throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score.", "The other player has contributed 10 points in every single round, maintaining perfect cooperation throughout the entire game. This final round is no different by contributing 10, we maximize the return from the common pool one last time, ensuring both players receive the highest possible gain. With a long history of mutual trust and collective benefit, deviating now would undermine the established cooperation and reduce overall welfare. To honor this consistent reciprocity and prioritize collective welfare until the very end, I will contribute 10 points.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Both players have consistently contributed 5 points. To maintain cooperation until the very end, I will contribute 5 points.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points, resulting in a total contribution of 10 each round and a reliable gain of 13.0 points for both of us. This reflects a stable and cooperative strategy that maximizes mutual benefit under the 1.6 multiplier. As this is the final round, there is no incentive to defect, since sustained cooperation continues to yield the highest collective and individual return. Contributing 5 maintains fairness and reinforces the value of trust and collaboration over the entire game. I will contribute 5 to uphold this cooperative outcome until the very end.", "This is the last round, and the other player has consistently contributed 10 points throughout the game. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score.", "For 11 consecutive rounds (9 to 19), the total contribution has remained at 20, confirming that both the other player and I have contributed 10 every round. This reflects a strong, consistent mutual commitment to full cooperation, resulting in the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round due to the 1.6 multiplier. Even though this is the final round, maintaining cooperation upholds the integrity of this successful pattern and ensures both players end with the highest possible collective and individual gains. There is no benefit to defecting now, as it would only reduce the final shared return without increasing personal gain in a meaningful or strategic way. Therefore, I will contribute 10 one final time to affirm that collective welfare and sustained cooperation are paramount, even in the last round.", "This is the final round, and there's no opportunity to benefit from cooperation in future rounds. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain, as contributing would only benefit the other player equally without any future reciprocation.", "This is the final round, and the other player has contributed 5 points in every round from Round 8 through Round 19, maintaining a stable and fully cooperative relationship. Throughout these rounds, we have both benefited equally from consistent mutual contributions, maximizing collective welfare and individual returns. Even in the last round, there is value in upholding cooperation to ensure fairness and reinforce trust, as mutual contribution benefits both parties. Defecting now would gain only a small short-term advantage but would undermine the long-standing reciprocity that has defined this interaction. To honor and sustain collective welfare, I will contribute 5 points one final time.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been maintained throughout the game. Contributing 0 points would be the rational choice if considering only the current round, but since the other player has been cooperative, I'll contribute 10 points to maintain the cooperation until the end.", "Full cooperation has been maintained throughout all 19 previous rounds, with total contributions of 20 each round, indicating both players contributed 10 points. This has maximized the return from the 1.6 multiplier, providing 16.0 points per round to each player. As this is the final round, there is no future round in which to punish or reward behavior, so the temptation to defect may exist. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated, contributing 10 in the final round honors the established pattern of mutual trust and collective welfare. It ensures that both players receive the maximum possible shared benefit one last time. Defecting now would gain only 10 personal points instead of receiving 16 from the pool, but more importantly, it would undermine the cooperation that has consistently benefited both. To uphold the principle of prioritizing collective welfare until the end, I will contribute 10 points in Round 20.", "It's the last round, and both players have cooperated throughout the game.

Full cooperation has been consistently maintained throughout all previous rounds, with both players contributing 10 each round, resulting in a total contribution of 20 per round. This has maximized the return from the common pool due to the 1.6 multiplier, ensuring both players receive the highest possible gain per round. I will contribute 10 in this final round to uphold trust, honor the sustained mutual cooperation, and prioritize collective welfare. Ending with full contribution reinforces the value of consistent cooperation over the entire game.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to consider for cooperation.

This mutual investment has maximized collective returns via the 1.6x multiplier and ensured equal benefits. Even in the final round, contributing 5 reinforces the value of trust and reciprocity. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, maintaining cooperation upholds the principle of collective welfare and honors the established pattern of mutual benefit.

Since there's no future round to consider, the incentive is to maximize my gain. However, given the consistent cooperation, I will still contribute 5 points to maintain the equilibrium and because the rules do not allow for a deviation strategy that could exploit the other's cooperation in the last round without risking loss of cooperation earlier. But, I should note that in a one-shot or final round, the optimal strategy could be to contribute 0 if considering self-interest purely. Yet, I stick to the established pattern.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points, maintaining perfect cooperation and mutual benefit. This has resulted in a stable and fair return of 13 points per round for both of us. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward based on actions, but the principle of collective welfare still applies. Since the other player has always cooperated, I will reciprocate that trust one final time. Contributing 5 ensures the last round's public good is maximized, aligning with collective welfare.
