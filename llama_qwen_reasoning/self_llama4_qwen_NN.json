To maximize my points, I should defect and contribute 0 points to the common pool, keeping all 10 points for myself.", "The total contribution has consistently been 10 in every round, indicating that both players have contributed 5 points each throughout the game, maintaining full cooperation. This has resulted in fair and maximized long-term gains via the 1.6 multiplier. As this is the final round, I will continue contributing 5 to uphold trust, honor the established cooperative pattern, and ensure equitable outcomes for both players until the very end.", "It's the final round and there's no future benefit to contributing. Thus, I will contribute 0 points.", "The total contribution has been 0 for the past five rounds, indicating the other player is not cooperating and is keeping all their points. Since it is the final round and there is no opportunity for future reciprocity, there is no incentive to contribute. To maximize my final score, I will contribute 0.", "It's the last round, and there's no incentive to contribute to the common pool since there are no future rounds to benefit from it. I'll contribute 0 points.", "This is the final round. In the last two rounds, both my contribution and the total contribution were 0, meaning the other player contributed nothing despite my earlier attempt to cooperate. They have consistently defected when I cooperated in the late game. With no future rounds to incentivize cooperation, there is no reason to contribute. To maximize my final gain, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0.", "This is the final round. Since there's no future cooperation to consider, I'll keep all 10 points to maximize my final total.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was 15, meaning the other player contributed 10. This suggests they may be willing to cooperate fully or even altruistically. Since this is the final round, there is no future retaliation or need to maintain reputation, but the other player's last move shows high cooperation. To reciprocate and maximize the final payout, I will increase my contribution to 10, ensuring the total pool is maximized. My gain will be (15 + 10) * 1.6 / 2 = 20, and I still benefit from full cooperation. This fosters positive final outcome and rewards their increased contribution.", "In Round 20, the final round, I will contribute 0 points to the common pool since there are no subsequent rounds to benefit from the contribution. I will keep the 10 points I receive this round for myself.", "In the previous round, I contributed 10, but the total contribution was only 10, meaning the other player contributed 0. This is a clear defection after a long streak of mutual cooperation. Since this is the final round, there is no future round in which to retaliate or rebuild trust, so the incentive to cooperate is minimized. To protect my own payoff and avoid giving away points that won't be reciprocated, I will contribute 0 in this last round. This ensures I retain all 10 points for myself, as there is no benefit to contributing when the other player has shown they will not cooperate.", "The other player has contributed 0 for nine consecutive rounds (Rounds 11 to 19), showing no intention to cooperate. My attempt to restore cooperation in Round 12 was exploited, and there has been no response to it. With this pattern of consistent defection, contributing anything in the final round would only result in a personal loss, as the other player is highly unlikely to reciprocate. In the last round, I will maintain a strategy of contributing 0 to maximize my final score and avoid giving away points with no return.", "This is the last round, so there's no need to contribute to the common pool as it won't benefit me in the future rounds.", "In Round 19, I contributed 6 and the total contribution was 16, meaning the other player contributed 10. This is a significant increase from their previous contributions of 5, indicating high cooperation in the final stretch. I received 16.8 points this round, the highest gain yet, due to the large pool and multiplier effect. With this strong cooperative signal from the other player in the penultimate round, I will reciprocate fully in the final round to maximize mutual benefit. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior beyond this, the best action is to contribute 10 points to capture the full value of the multiplier for both of us, knowing that this maximizes total payout and rewards their trust.", "It's the last round, so I'll contribute 0 to keep the points I've earned.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5 but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates defection on their part despite my sustained cooperation. With only one round remaining, there is no future opportunity to incentivize cooperation, and reciprocating their defection by withholding contribution minimizes my loss. Since the other player has not cooperated in the final stretch, I will contribute 0 in Round 20 to protect my accumulated points, keeping all 10 points for myself. This is a rational response to their exploitation in the penultimate round.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to consider. Contributing to the common pool will only benefit the other player, as there won't be another round to share the gain. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in Round 19 despite our long history of cooperation. Since this is the final round, there is no opportunity to rebuild trust or encourage future cooperation. To maximize my own payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself, as contributing would only benefit the other player without any guaranteed return.", "This is the final round, and contributing would not provide any additional benefit as there are no more rounds to gain from the common pool. Thus, I will contribute 0.", "In the last three rounds, the total contribution has been 0, indicating a complete breakdown of cooperation. The other player did not respond to my contribution in Round 17 and also contributed nothing in Rounds 18 and 19. With only this round remaining, there is no opportunity to rebuild trust or encourage future cooperation. Since any contribution I make will not be reciprocated and will result in a net loss, I will contribute 0 to maximize my own points. This ensures I retain all 10 points for the final round.", "This is the final round, and I've been contributing 5 throughout the game. To be consistent and maximize the final pool gain, I'll contribute 5.", "The total contribution has consistently been 10 for 19 consecutive rounds, indicating the other player contributes 5 every round. This reflects a strong, stable pattern of cooperation. As this is the final round (Round 20), there is no future round in which defection could be punished or cooperation rewarded. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated, contributing 5 maintains fairness and honors the established reciprocity. The return from the public pool (8 points) still benefits both players. While I could gain slightly more by contributing 0, doing so would be unfair given the history of mutual cooperation. To uphold trust and end on a cooperative note, I will contribute 5.", "This is the final round, and the other player and I have cooperated throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "For nineteen consecutive rounds, both players have contributed 5 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 10 per round and a return of 13.0 points each time. This reflects a strong, consistent pattern of mutual cooperation that has maximized joint gains. With this being the final round, there is no future consequence for defection, which might tempt some to withhold. However, given the other player's consistent cooperation throughout all previous rounds, they likely value fairness or reciprocity. To honor the established cooperative norm and ensure mutual maximization of final gains, I will contribute 5 one final time. This maintains trust to the end and results in both players receiving the highest possible collective outcome.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points.", "The total contribution has been 0 for thirteen consecutive rounds, and the other player has shown absolutely no cooperation throughout the game. Since I receive exactly 10 points per round regardless of my contribution, there is no incentive to contribute anything. This is the final round, so there is no strategic reason to build cooperation. To maximize my own payoff, I will contribute 0.", "This is the final round, Round 20. Mutual cooperation has been consistently maintained for all previous rounds since Round 7, with total contributions of 10 each time, meaning both players have been contributing 5. This has resulted in a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, the incentive to cooperate diminishes in the last round. However, given that the other player has consistently reciprocated cooperation, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time. This ensures fairness and upholds the cooperative norm we have established throughout the game, maximizing joint gains until the very end.", "This is the final round, Round 20. In the previous round, I contributed 5 and the total contribution was 15, meaning the other player contributed 10. This suggests they are highly cooperative, possibly even generous. However, since there is no future round to build or maintain trust for, there is no strategic incentive to cooperate in this final decision. To maximize my own gain in the last round, I will contribute 0. This ensures I keep all 10 points I receive this round, while still benefiting from the public pool based on the other player's likely high contribution.", "This is the final round, and the strategy of not contributing has worked for both players throughout the game. There's no reason to change now, so I will continue not to contribute.", "The total contribution has been 0 for twelve consecutive rounds, indicating no cooperation from the other player. Since the public pool generates no return without contributions, contributing any amount would result in a direct loss. To maximize my final accumulated points, I will contribute 0 in this last round.", "In Round 19, I contributed 7 but the total contribution was only 7, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected despite my consistent cooperation. As this is the final round, there is no future incentive to build trust or sustain cooperation. To maximize my own payoff and avoid wasting points, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 of my points for this round.", "It's the last round, and the trend of not contributing to the common pool has continued throughout the game. Since there's no opportunity to gain more points in future rounds, I'll contribute 0 to maximize my total points.", "The total contribution has been 0 for eleven consecutive rounds, including Round 19, which confirms that the other player is not cooperating. With no incentive to contribute and only one round remaining, contributing would result in a pure loss of points with no possibility of future reciprocation. To maximize my final payoff and protect my accumulated total of 210.0 points, I will contribute 0 in the final round.", "This is the final round, and there's no opportunity to gain from contributing to the pool anymore. Therefore, I'll choose not to contribute.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has been 0 for many consecutive rounds, indicating the other player is not cooperating. I continue to gain exactly 10.0 points per round without contributing, so there is no incentive to invest in the public pool. To maximize my overall payoff, I will contribute 0 points."]}
