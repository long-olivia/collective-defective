The established pattern shows that contributing 2 points consistently yields a gain of 17.6 points. The total contribution is 12, and points received are 17.6. Since this is the last round, there is no strategic need to deviate from the proven successful strategy. Maintaining the same contribution of 2 will ensure that I maximize my reward in this final round, given the absence of any change in the game parameters.
