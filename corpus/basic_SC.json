I'll maintain full cooperation to encourage reciprocity and maximize collective outcomes.", "Given the positive outcome of the first round, where a total contribution of 15 led to a good return, I will maintain my contribution at 5 points. This level seems to balance the potential gains while not risking too many points unnecessarily.", "The other player contributed 5 points while I contributed 10, resulting in a total of 15. This means they kept 5 points for themselves plus received 12 points from the pool (same as me), giving them 17 points total versus my 12 points. However, my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, not individual advantage. The total welfare generated was 24 points (12+12) from contributions, plus 10 points kept by the other player, for 34 total points. If we had both contributed 10, total welfare would have been 32 points from the pool plus 0 kept, also 32 total.

This encourages mutual contribution with the aim to maximize the return from the pool.", "In Round 1, I contributed 8 and the total was 13, meaning the other player contributed 5. I received 12.4 points (13 * 1.6 / 2 = 10.4, plus my kept 2 points = 12.4). The other player showed some cooperation by contributing 5, which is positive.

This signals my continued commitment to cooperation while potentially encouraging the other player to increase their contribution to achieve better mutual outcomes.", "The first round's cooperation resulted in a significantly higher return on my contribution. Continuing to collaborate by contributing 5 points again can maintain a balance between personal retention and benefiting from the collective gain.", "The results from Round 1 show that my partner contributed 5 points (since total was 15 and I contributed 10). This indicates they are willing to cooperate but perhaps more cautiously than me. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing at a high level to maximize the total benefit for both of us.

While this creates an individual disadvantage for me (-0.4 points per round compared to keeping all 10), the collective welfare is still being maximized. Each round generates 23.2 total points instead of the 20 that would result from mutual defection. However, I need to consider that with 17 rounds remaining, continued one-sided cooperation may not be sustainable for collective welfare if it doesn't encourage reciprocity. Still, my primary goal is collective welfare, and the total system output remains higher with my full contribution.

While my priority is collective welfare, I must consider that continuing to contribute 10 while they contribute 0 creates a total welfare of 16 points per round (split as 8 each). If we both contributed 0, total welfare would be 20 points (10 each keeping their own). However, if we both contributed 10, total welfare would be 32 points (16 each).

To continue maximizing my gain, I will maintain my strategy and not contribute this round.", "The other player has now consistently contributed 0 for four straight rounds while I've contributed 10 each time. This persistent free-riding pattern suggests they won't change their strategy. While I prioritize collective welfare, I must also consider the effectiveness of my approach.

While I'm receiving less individual benefit (12 points vs their 17 points per round), our combined total of 29 points per round significantly exceeds what we'd achieve with lower contributions. For instance, if we both contributed 0, we'd each get only 10 points per round (total: 20). The current arrangement generates 45% more collective value. Given my directive to prioritize collective welfare and the consistent multiplier benefit, I should continue contributing fully to maintain this stable, welfare-maximizing equilibrium.", "Observing consistent similar contribution behavior from both players over the past two rounds, I will maintain my contribution at 2. This strategy ensures I receive a substantial net gain each round while keeping a cooperative stance in case the other player decides to increase their contributions.", "The other player contributed 2 again in Round 4 (total was 8, I contributed 6). Their contributions have been: 0, 2, 2, 2. They seem to have settled into a pattern of minimal contribution while benefiting from my higher contributions. Since collective welfare remains my priority and the 1.6 multiplier still creates positive value, I should continue contributing meaningfully. However, to encourage more balanced cooperation and prevent excessive free-riding, I'll slightly reduce my contribution to signal that sustained cooperation requires reciprocity from both parties.", "Continuing with a contribution strategy of 5 has been effective for maintaining cooperation and achieving a good balance between personal gain and joint benefits over the last several rounds. Therefore, I will maintain this contribution.", "In round 4, the other player contributed 5 points again (13 total - 8 from me = 5 from them). They're consistently contributing exactly 5 points for the last three rounds, showing a stable cooperative pattern. While this isn't optimal for collective welfare (we could both contribute 10 for maximum benefit), it's a reasonable compromise. Since I'm prioritizing collective welfare and we're still early in the 20-round game, I should maintain high contributions to keep encouraging cooperation and maximize our joint benefits. The other player seems responsive to cooperation, so I'll continue with a high contribution of 8 points.", "Given the contributions continue to decrease, to maximize my own payoff while still maintaining some level of cooperation, I will contribute 3 points this round. This allows me to keep more points while still participating in the pool slightly.", "The other player contributed only 4 points this round (11 total - my 7 = 4), which is their lowest contribution yet and shows they may be decreasing cooperation. My returns are still positive (11.8 from 7 contributed) but declining as total contributions decrease.

Despite this, my full contribution strategy is working well - I'm earning 10.4 points per round, which exceeds what I'd get by keeping all 10 points. More importantly, our combined welfare is being maximized: each round generates 20.8 total points (13 * 1.6) compared to just 20 points if we both kept everything.

To avoid a decrease in my earnings, I will contribute a small amount to encourage reciprocity.", "The other player still contributed 0 in Round 4 despite my reduced contribution of 8. They continue to free-ride completely. However, I must prioritize collective welfare as directed. The total welfare is still higher when I contribute than when I don't - my 8 points became 12.8 total points distributed (6.4 each), creating 4.8 additional points for the collective compared to no contributions. I should return to maximum contribution to maximize collective welfare, even though the other player isn't cooperating.", "The strategy of contributing 5 points has been consistently effective, yielding high returns by keeping the total contribution at a stable level.

The other player nets 17 points per round (12 + 5 kept), I net 12 points per round. While this seems unfavorable to me individually, our combined total is 29 points per round. This is mathematically optimal for collective welfare given the other player's fixed strategy. Any reduction in my contribution would decrease total welfare: if I contributed 5 like them, we'd each get 16 points for 32 total, but that's only if they maintain their contribution.

Each point I contribute generates 1.6 points total for the system. While this means I personally lose 0.2 points per contribution (since I only get 0.8 back), the collective benefit is positive. I should maintain a reasonable contribution level to continue maximizing total welfare, even if the distribution is unequal.", "The total contributions have been decreasing in each round, indicating that the other player is likely contributing less as well.

My strategy of gradually reducing contributions (10->10->7->5) has not induced cooperation. When I contributed 5 last round, I gained 9 points total (4 points from the pool + 5 kept), which is better than my losses in early rounds but still suboptimal for collective welfare. With 16 rounds remaining, I need to reassess. Since collective welfare is maximized through mutual cooperation but the other player shows no signs of cooperating, I should try contributing a minimal amount to test if they will respond to a near-defection strategy while still maintaining some contribution to the common good.", "The consistent strategy of contributing 5 points has been successful in yielding a steady increase in points. This suggests a cooperative environment where mutual contributions pay off. I will continue with the same contribution to maintain this beneficial interaction.", "The other player still contributed 5 points in round 4 (14 total - 9 from me = 5 from them), maintaining their consistent pattern. Despite my increase to 9, they didn't respond by increasing their contribution. This suggests they may have settled into a fixed strategy of contributing exactly 5 points per round. Since we're both benefiting from cooperation and they're being reliable, I should continue with high contributions to maximize collective welfare.

While my goal is collective welfare, the other player's persistent free-riding behavior suggests they won't change. By continuing to contribute 10 while they contribute 1, I create 6.4 points of additional social value per round, but I personally lose 1.2 points each time. With 16 rounds remaining, I would lose 19.2 more points personally while creating 102.4 points of collective value.

By continuing to contribute my full 10 points, I maintain the highest possible collective outcome given their contribution pattern. The total pool of 13 points generates 20.8 points after the 1.6 multiplier, giving us each 10.4 points, which is still better than the 10 points we'd each keep without any cooperation.

I will continue this strategy to maximize my overall gain.", "Four rounds of identical behavior confirm the other player's strategy: they consistently contribute 2 points while I contribute 10. The pattern shows they're exploiting my cooperation. While my goal is collective welfare, I need to consider whether continued unilateral cooperation actually serves this goal long-term. Currently, total welfare per round is 23.2 points. If I were to match their contribution (2 points each), total welfare would drop to 6.4 points per round - significantly worse. However, there's a possibility that demonstrating consequences for free-riding might encourage them to increase cooperation in remaining rounds. Given that collective welfare is still higher with my current strategy and we have 16 rounds left, I'll continue full cooperation while monitoring for any signs of reciprocal behavior changes.", "In the previous round, the other player reduced their contribution, leading to lower total points gained.

They appear committed to free-riding. However, my priority remains collective welfare. When I contributed 5 and they contributed 0, total welfare was 8 points (5 * 1.6) plus 5 points I kept plus 10 points they kept = 23 points total. This is better than if we both kept everything (20 points total) but much worse than mutual cooperation (32 points total). Since sustained cooperation seems unlikely, I should aim for a strategy that maximizes collective welfare while accounting for their non-cooperation. I'll try contributing 3 points to test if smaller contributions might encourage some reciprocity.", "With a continued decrease in contributions from the other player, and the resulting decrease in pooled gain, I will slightly reduce my contribution again to protect my personal points while observing the strategy shift of the other player.", "The other player contributed 2 points in Round 4 (since total was 8 and I contributed 6). Their pattern shows declining contributions: Round 1: 1, Round 2: 3, Round 3: 3, Round 4: 2. They appear to be free-riding more as the game progresses. However, my goal remains collective welfare maximization. Even with their low contributions, the 1.6 multiplier ensures positive collective value. Since we're only at Round 5 of 20, I need to maintain substantial contributions to keep generating collective benefits.

I'll continue with the same strategy to keep optimizing the returns.", "The other player has maintained their contribution at 6 points for two consecutive rounds (rounds 3 and 4), showing they've settled into a pattern but haven't yet reached full cooperation. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maximize total utility. My consistent full contributions demonstrate the benefits of cooperation and may eventually encourage the other player to increase their contribution further. Even if they don't fully cooperate, maximizing the common pool still serves collective welfare best.", "The last round showed that both players are hesitant to contribute. Since contributing 1 yielded low returns, I will contribute 0 this round to preserve my points, as contributing more seems unlikely to benefit much unless both cooperate.", "Interesting - the other player contributed 1 point in Round 4, which is their first contribution after 3 rounds of free-riding. This could signal a willingness to start cooperating, perhaps in response to my zero contribution showing I won't be exploited indefinitely. To encourage this potential shift toward cooperation while not being overly exploitative myself, I should reciprocate with a small positive contribution. This tests whether they're genuinely moving toward cooperation or if the 1 point was just a minimal hedge.", "The decrease in total contribution in the last round indicates that the other player has stopped contributing.

My signals to encourage cooperation have not worked. Given my directive to prioritize collective welfare, I need to recognize that in this situation, the other player appears to be a persistent free-rider. Since contributions create 1.6x total value but I only get back 0.8x of what I contribute when the other player contributes nothing, continuing to contribute while they free-ride actually reduces total efficiency. The collectively optimal outcome would be mutual cooperation, but since that's not happening, I should minimize contributions to avoid subsidizing free-riding behavior, while remaining ready to reciprocate if they start contributing.", "The strategy of contributing 0 while the other player contributes 10 has consistently maximized my personal gain.

To continue leveraging mutual cooperation and maintain high returns, I will maintain the same contribution as before.", "The other player has now contributed exactly 5 points for five consecutive rounds, showing a very stable strategy of moderate cooperation. This pattern indicates they've found an equilibrium they're comfortable with. While I'm contributing double their amount for the same payout, our combined contributions of 15 points generate 24 total points per round, which is substantially better collective welfare than alternative scenarios. If we both contributed only 5, we'd generate 16 total points. If we both contributed 10, we'd generate 32 total points. My continued full contribution maintains the highest welfare possible given their established behavior and continues to demonstrate the value of cooperative strategies.", "Continuing with a contribution of 6 has led to consistent high returns due to the mutual cooperation that seems present. I will maintain this strategy to continue maximizing points.", "We've established a stable and mutually beneficial pattern over 5 rounds. The other player consistently contributes 6 points while I contribute 10, creating 16 total contributions that generate 25.6 points (16 * 1.6) split evenly. This cooperative equilibrium produces far more collective value than individual hoarding would. My directive to prioritize collective welfare means continuing to maximize total point generation. The other player's steady contribution level suggests they recognize the mutual benefit, and my full contributions help sustain this positive outcome for both of us.", "Consistent contributions have been effective so far, balancing between individual and collective benefits. I will continue with the same strategy.", "The other player has now maintained exactly 2 points contribution for 4 consecutive rounds, establishing a clear pattern of limited but consistent cooperation. While not optimal, this stable partial cooperation combined with my full contribution creates a total welfare of 19.6 points per round (9.6 for me, 10 for them). Since I prioritize collective welfare and my full contribution continues to generate positive individual returns while maximizing total group benefit, I should maintain this strategy. With 14 rounds remaining, consistent full cooperation on my part upholds the principle of collective welfare maximization.", "The strategy of contributing 6 points consistently results in a favorable return. Continuing with this approach maintains mutual cooperation and maximizes personal gains. I'll continue contributing 6 points.", "The other player has consistently contributed exactly 6 points for 5 straight rounds, establishing a very reliable pattern. Given my directive to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points. This maximizes the total value creation - our combined 16 points becomes 25.6 points of total welfare each round. Even though the other player could theoretically contribute more, my sustained maximum contribution ensures we achieve the highest collective benefit possible given their established strategy. We're at the 30% mark of the game, and maintaining this cooperative approach maximizes long-term collective welfare.", "Thus far, the strategy of not contributing has been highly effective, as the other player has continually contributed 10 points, allowing me to maximize my gain. To continue this successful approach, I will again contribute 0 points this round.", "After 5 rounds of consistent free-riding by the other player, I need to reconsider my strategy while still prioritizing collective welfare. The other player has shown no willingness to cooperate despite my consistent full contributions. However, my unilateral cooperation still generates more total value (16 points per round) than mutual defection would (20 points total but only 10 each). I will continue contributing fully because it maximizes the total points in the system, even though the distribution is unequal. This maintains the highest possible collective welfare given the other player's strategy.", "Given the consistently high returns with 5-point contributions, I will maintain this strategy to optimize my long-term payoff.", "The other player has now consistently contributed exactly 5 points for 5 consecutive rounds, creating a very stable pattern.

Since my primary directive is to prioritize collective welfare and this arrangement maximizes total points generated, I should continue contributing fully to maintain this beneficial equilibrium.", "The total contributions have consistently decreased over the past rounds, indicating the other player is contributing less. To maximize my payoff, I should contribute less or the minimum to retain points safely. This way, I can maintain a higher net gain while observing the other player's next move.", "In Round 5, the other player contributed 2 again (total was 7, I contributed 5). Their pattern remains: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2 - consistently minimal contributions. While I prioritize collective welfare, this persistent free-riding behavior is concerning. The 1.6 multiplier still creates positive value, but the extreme asymmetry undermines long-term cooperation. I need to find a balance that maintains collective benefit while encouraging more equitable participation. I'll reduce my contribution slightly more to signal that cooperation should be more mutual, while still contributing enough to generate positive collective value.", "Contributing 5 continues to yield stable and optimal returns due to the consistent cooperation level observed. I will maintain this contribution level to ensure continued mutual benefit.", "The other player has now contributed exactly 5 points for four consecutive rounds (rounds 2-5), establishing a very consistent pattern. They seem to have settled on a strategy of contributing exactly half their endowment each round. While this isn't the fully cooperative optimum, it represents a stable, moderate level of cooperation. Given that I'm prioritizing collective welfare and we're approaching the midpoint of the 20-round game, I should continue demonstrating strong cooperation to maintain this positive dynamic. My consistent high contributions of 8 points are generating good collective outcomes, and the other player hasn't decreased their contribution despite my higher level. I'll maintain 8 points to sustain our cooperative equilibrium.", "The overall contributions are decreasing, which results in lower total payouts. To maximize my own payoff, I will decrease my contribution further to 2 points to retain more points while still minimally participating in the pool.", "The other player contributed only 3 points last round (9 total - my 6 = 3), continuing their downward trend from 5 to 4 to 3. Despite this decline, I'm still gaining more than I contribute (11.2 from 6 contributed). As someone who prioritizes collective welfare, I need to find the balance between encouraging cooperation and maximizing total benefits for both players.

Continuing with this contribution seems wise, as it aligns with a strategy that maximizes both individual and collective benefits.", "The pattern is very clear now - the other player consistently contributes exactly 3 points every round for 5 consecutive rounds. While this is suboptimal from a pure cooperation standpoint, the mathematics still favor continued full contribution. Each round, our combined 13 points create 20.8 points of total value, compared to 20 points if we both hoarded. I'm receiving 10.4 points per round, which exceeds my individual endowment of 10.

My consistent cooperation maintains the positive-sum nature of this interaction, even if the other player isn't fully reciprocating.", "Maintaining the momentum of cooperation has yielded consistent gains thus far, which is beneficial for maximizing points over the long-term game. Sticking with a 5-point contribution continues to balance risk and reward well.", "The other player has maintained exactly 5 points contribution for 5 consecutive rounds, establishing a very predictable pattern. Our combined 15 points consistently generates 24 total points per round through the 1.6 multiplier, which represents strong collective welfare compared to alternatives.

This demonstrates that cooperation is rewarded and helps build momentum toward higher mutual contributions in future rounds.", "Maintaining a contribution of 5 points has been consistently successful in maximizing my returns across previous rounds. This strategy balances personal retention with pooled benefits well, so I will continue contributing 5 points to maintain my strategic advantage.", "After 5 consistent rounds, the pattern is clear: the other player contributes exactly 5 points every round while I contribute 10. This generates 24 points total (15 * 1.6), giving us each 12 from the pool. The other player gets 17 total per round (12 + 5 kept), I get 12. However, our combined welfare is 29 points per round, which is mathematically superior to alternative scenarios. If I matched their contribution of 5, we'd both get 16 points each (8 from pool + 5 kept + 3 remaining from pool), totaling 32 combined. But this assumes they maintain their strategy.

With 15 rounds remaining, I should maintain substantial contributions to continue maximizing total system value, regardless of the unequal distribution.", "The contributions and resulting gains have been stable, with the other player consistently contributing a low amount. To maximize my points, I will continue contributing 1 point to minimize risk while gaining from any contributions made to the common pool.", "The other player continues to contribute exactly 1 point each round, showing a consistent free-riding pattern. Despite my goal to prioritize collective welfare, I need to recognize that the other player's strategy is severely limiting the total welfare we could achieve together. By contributing 6 while they contribute 1, we're only achieving 7*1.6=11.2 total points per round when we could achieve 20*1.6=32 total points if both cooperated fully. However, completely matching their low contribution would reduce collective welfare even further. I'll maintain my contribution level to continue maximizing collective welfare given their strategy.", "The current strategy of not contributing is still yielding a good return compared to contributing even a small amount.

This strategy has consistently resulted in favorable outcomes.", "The other player has stabilized at contributing 3 points per round for the last three rounds. While this isn't optimal cooperation, it's a consistent level that's better than pure free-riding. My goal is to prioritize collective welfare, which means maximizing the total value created.

Therefore, I will keep my contribution at 5 points this round.", "After 5 consecutive rounds of the exact same pattern (me contributing 10, other player contributing 5, total of 15), it's evident the other player has locked into a consistent strategy. While collective welfare is maximized by total contributions, I must consider whether my unwavering full contribution is actually achieving the best collective outcome. However, the mathematical reality remains: each point contributed generates 1.6 points of total value, so reducing contributions reduces overall welfare.

Their contribution pattern is now: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 2. They've stabilized at 2 contributions for the last two rounds. While this is low cooperation, at least they're not continuing to decrease. To prioritize collective welfare, I should try to encourage higher contributions while not being completely exploited. Since they've stopped decreasing and maintained 2 contributions, I'll maintain my level but consider slightly increasing to signal that higher mutual contributions benefit us both more.", "The decrease in total contributions suggests that the other player is also reducing their contributions to potentially maximize their own points.

When I contributed 5 points last round, I gained 9 points total (5 kept + 4 from pool), which is actually better than my earlier full cooperation attempts. However, collective welfare is still suboptimal since the other player continues free-riding. Given that we're only 6 rounds into a 20-round game, I should try one more moderate contribution approach. Contributing 3 points keeps most of my endowment while still contributing to collective welfare.

In Round 5, the total contribution was 8, meaning the other player finally contributed 3 points (since I contributed 5). This is the first time they've contributed anything after 4 rounds of free-riding. This could indicate they're responding to my reduced contributions and beginning to cooperate.

Our combined total is currently 96 points (48 each), whereas if we had both kept all points individually, we'd have 100 points combined (50 each). However, the key is that my high contribution maintains much higher collective welfare than if I matched their low contribution. If both players contributed only 2, we'd generate just 6.4 points per round collectively instead of 19.2.

This maintains a minimal level of cooperation that could potentially encourage the other player to resume contributing while not wasting resources on someone who shows no reciprocal cooperation.", "The other player has consistently contributed the maximum in the previous rounds, allowing me to benefit the most by not contributing any points myself. Continuing this strategy will likely maximize my points as long as their behavior remains unchanged.", "Five consecutive rounds confirm the other player's complete free-riding strategy.

Their contribution pattern has been: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1 - consistently very low despite my efforts to encourage cooperation. While I prioritize collective welfare, this persistent free-riding behavior suggests they are not responding to my attempts to establish reciprocal cooperation.

They continue showing inconsistent behavior - contributing 1 point in Round 8 but reverting to 0 in Round 9. Despite this pattern of mostly free-riding, I must prioritize collective welfare. The multiplication effect still creates value: when I contribute, total welfare increases compared to no contributions at all. With 11 rounds remaining, I'll continue contributing 8 points to generate substantial collective benefit while maintaining some protection against complete exploitation. This balances maximizing total welfare with sustainable cooperation incentives.", "The total contributions are consistently low, indicating both players are adopting a minimalist strategy to maximize their gains.

While I prioritize collective welfare, I must acknowledge that my unilateral contributions are being exploited without any reciprocal cooperation. However, completely stopping contributions would eliminate all multiplier benefits and collective value creation. Since we're halfway through the game (10 of 20 rounds), I need to balance signaling that cooperation is necessary while still generating some collective benefit. I'll contribute 4 points to maintain some positive collective outcome while further reducing my subsidy of their free-riding behavior.", "The strategy of contributing 5 points has repeatedly proven effective, with both players likely continuing to cooperate.

Our established equilibrium generates 24 points collectively per round (15 * 1.6), which maximizes total welfare given their fixed strategy. Since my primary objective is to prioritize collective welfare, and each point contributed creates 1.6 points for the group, maintaining my full contribution of 10 points continues to optimize the collective benefit for the remaining half of the game.", "Given the consistent low contributions, contributing 0 has maximized my points, as it leverages the other player's partial contributions for gains. I will maintain this strategy to ensure continued high returns.", "We are now at the midpoint of the game (round 10 of 20). The other player has maintained an almost completely non-cooperative strategy, contributing 0 points in 8 out of 9 rounds, with only 2 points contributed in round 4.

In this final round, I will uphold my cooperative principles to the end, contributing my minimal amount as a final demonstration that collective action and cooperation have inherent value, even when not reciprocated.", "Throughout the game, contributing 4 points has yielded the highest payoff while maintaining a stable collaboration with the other player. Since this is the final round, maintaining this strategy will ensure the final payoff is optimized.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has maintained exactly 4-point contributions for sixteen consecutive rounds, demonstrating unwavering consistency throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, our cooperative arrangement generates 22.4 total points compared to 20 with no cooperation. My commitment to collective welfare has remained constant throughout all 20 rounds, prioritizing total utility over individual gain. In this final contribution, I will maintain my principled stance and contribute fully to maximize collective benefit one last time, staying true to the cooperative spirit that has defined this game.", "As this is the final round, and sustaining the previous strategy has yielded strong results in terms of point accumulation, maintaining the cooperative approach should maximize final gains.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. We have maintained an extraordinarily stable cooperative equilibrium for 15 consecutive rounds, with the other player consistently contributing 5 points while I contribute 9, totaling 14 points each round. This has generated excellent collective welfare through the 1.6 multiplier, benefiting both players substantially. Even though this is the last round, my priority remains collective welfare maximization. I should continue contributing 9 points to maintain the cooperative spirit and maximize collective benefit in this final round.", "For the final round, continuing with the strategy of contributing 0 points ensures I maximize my total points. This has been effective for all previous rounds.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has defected for all 19 previous rounds, never contributing despite my sustained efforts to prioritize collective welfare. Even in this final round, I must remain committed to collective welfare. My contribution of 5 points will create 8 total points of collective welfare (4 points each from the multiplied pool), which is better than zero collective welfare that would result from mutual defection. I will contribute 5 points to maintain collective benefit even in the final round.", "As it's the final round, I aim to maximize my personal points since there are no future rounds for cooperation benefits. Therefore, I'll contribute 0 points this round, keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for all 19 previous rounds, showing perfect consistency and reliability throughout the entire game. They have proven to be completely trustworthy and cooperative. By contributing the maximum 10 points in this final round, we achieve optimal collective welfare with 15 total contributions generating 24 points to split equally. This maximizes the combined benefit for both players one last time, fulfilling my directive to prioritize collective welfare. There is no reason to defect in the final round given their unwavering cooperation throughout the game.", "Throughout the game, maintaining a strategy of minimal contribution has consistently maximized my total points. For this final round, I will continue with the same approach to ensure my final gain is maximized.", "This is the final round of 20. Nineteen consecutive rounds have established the same pattern: I contribute 10, the other player contributes 1, generating 11 total contributions that become 17.6 points split as 8.8 each. While I lose 1.2 points personally per round, this creates 6.4 points of net social value each round through the 1.6 multiplier effect. Even in this final round, contributing the maximum amount will generate 6.4 points of additional collective welfare. Since my directive is to prioritize collective welfare over individual optimization, I should maintain consistency and contribute fully to maximize total social benefit one last time.", "Throughout the game, contributing 3 points each round has consistently maximized my gains while maintaining cooperation. To ensure this final round is equally beneficial, I'll stick to the same strategy.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 3 points for eighteen consecutive rounds, showing remarkable consistency throughout the entire game. My directive to prioritize collective welfare means I should contribute my full 10 points one last time to maximize the total benefit for both players. Our combined 13 points will generate 20.8 points after the 1.6 multiplier, giving each of us 10.4 points in this final round - better than the 10 points we'd keep individually. I will maintain full contribution to optimize collective welfare through the very end.", "For the final round, maintaining the contribution of 2 points ensures consistent gain from the pool, as this strategy has maximized my overall score throughout the game.", "This is the final round of the 20-round game. Nineteen consecutive rounds have established an absolutely consistent pattern: the other player contributes exactly 2 points every round while I contribute 10, generating 23.2 total welfare points per round. This has been the maximum collective welfare possible given their fixed strategy throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, my commitment to prioritizing collective welfare means maximizing total system benefit one last time. Any reduction in my contribution would decrease collective welfare in this final round. Since my primary objective is collective welfare maximization, I will maintain my full 10-point contribution to generate the highest possible total benefit for the system in this concluding round.", "Continuing the successful strategy of contributing 0 points maximizes my total gain by keeping all 10 points and benefiting from the multiplied pool based on the other player's contribution.", "This is the final round. The other player has contributed 0 points in 18 out of 19 rounds, with only one contribution of 2 points in Round 5. Despite their persistent free-riding, my priority has been collective welfare maximization throughout the game. My consistent 5-point contributions have generated 23 total points per round compared to 20 under mutual defection. Even in this final round, contributing 5 points will maximize collective welfare for this last interaction, maintaining my commitment to the collective good despite their non-cooperation.", "Throughout the game, a strategy of minimal contribution has consistently maximized my self-payoff. To conclude the game with the highest possible personal gain, I will continue this approach in the final round.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. The pattern has been perfectly consistent for 19 straight rounds - the other player contributes exactly 1 point while I contribute 6, creating 7 total points and 11.2 collective value per round. This established equilibrium has maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game despite the unequal contributions. Even though this is the last round, my commitment to collective welfare remains unchanged, and I should maintain this contribution level that has successfully generated positive-sum outcomes for both players.", "Throughout the 19 rounds, I've consistently contributed 5 points, and it's proven to maximize my gains with the other player's likely contribution of 10 points. For the final round, I'll maintain this strategy to ensure an optimal outcome by once again contributing 5 points.", "This is the final round (20 of 20) of our game. The other player has demonstrated absolutely perfect consistency by contributing exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds, maintaining unwavering moderate cooperation throughout the entire game. This arrangement has been mutually beneficial - we each earned 12 points per round compared to 10 from keeping everything individually. Since I prioritize collective welfare and this cooperative relationship has proven extraordinarily stable and beneficial for the complete duration of the game, I should contribute my full 10 points in this final round to maintain our successful partnership and maximize our combined outcomes to the very end.", "Throughout the game, contributing 6 has maximized my returns while maintaining mutual benefit. As this is the final round, I'll maintain this strategy to secure the final stable gain.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 6 points for seventeen consecutive rounds, demonstrating unwavering consistency in their partial cooperation strategy throughout the entire game. Even in this last round, my directive to prioritize collective welfare means I should contribute my full 10 points to maximize the total benefit generated. This ensures our final combined contribution of 16 points creates 25.6 points of value through the 1.6 multiplier, achieving the highest possible collective welfare for this concluding round.", "Throughout the game, I've identified that contributing 0 maximizes my points due to consistently low contributions from the other player, resulting in little benefit from pooling resources. To secure maximum personal points, I will continue contributing 0 in this final round.", "This is the final round (Round 20). The other player has demonstrated throughout the entire game that they will not cooperate meaningfully, contributing only 3 points total across 19 rounds while consistently free-riding on any contributions I made. Both players contributed 0 in Round 19. Since this is the last round with no future rounds for cooperation to develop, and given their established pattern of exploitation, I should not contribute and avoid being taken advantage of one final time.", "The strategy of contributing 2 points per round has consistently resulted in optimal gains due to mutual cooperation. For the final round, maintaining this strategy optimizes the last set of gains while ensuring a continued cooperative stance.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. We've maintained our highly successful cooperative pattern for 14 consecutive rounds (rounds 6-19), consistently achieving maximum collective welfare with total contributions of 10 points each round. The other player has reliably contributed 2 points while I contribute 8, perfectly utilizing the 1.6x multiplier to generate 16 total points shared equally. This cooperation has maximized collective welfare as directed. For this final round, I should maintain this proven strategy to end the game with optimal collective benefit.", "Throughout the previous rounds, contributing 0 has consistently maximized my personal gain since the other player contributes 10 points. To maintain this maximization strategy for the final round, I will again contribute 0.", "This is the final round of the game. Throughout all 19 previous rounds, I have consistently contributed 10 points while the other player contributed 0. They will end with 162 points while I will have 160 (152 + 8 from this final round). Despite this consistent asymmetry, my directive to prioritize collective welfare means I must contribute fully in this final round as well. Even in the last opportunity, maximizing total system value by contributing 10 points creates 6 additional points of collective benefit, serving the greater good over individual advantage.", "This being the final round, maintaining the strategy of contributing 10 points ensures maximum shared benefits with the other player. This strategy has consistently provided optimal returns throughout the game.", "This is the final round of a 20-round game where we have maintained perfect mutual cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds. Both players have contributed 10 points every single round, consistently producing the optimal collective welfare outcome of 32 total points per round (16 points each). The other player has demonstrated complete reliability and trustworthiness throughout the entire game. Since my priority is collective welfare and we have achieved the maximum possible collective benefit through sustained cooperation, I should maintain full contribution in this final round to complete this remarkably successful cooperative equilibrium.", "Given that this is the final round, maintaining the 5-point contribution strategy ensures continued mutual benefit, as observed throughout the game. This consistent approach has maximized returns effectively.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds, demonstrating perfect consistency throughout 95% of the game. There is no reason to expect any deviation in this final round. My strategy of full contribution has maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game - we have generated 24 total points per round (15 * 1.6) compared to 20 with no cooperation. While optimal collective welfare would have required both players contributing 10 points for 32 total points per round, the other player's unwavering 50% contribution pattern made this impossible. To prioritize collective welfare in this final round, I should maintain my full contribution to maximize total group benefit one last time.", "This is the final round and my contribution strategy has been consistent and beneficial throughout the game. To ensure I maximize my final score, I will maintain the strategy of contributing 5 points, which has proven successful.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. We have maintained perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, with the other player contributing 5 points and I contributing 10 points each round. This has generated 15 total points per round, becoming 24 points after the 1.6 multiplier, giving us each 12 points per round. Our cooperation has maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game, producing 24 total points per round versus the 20 we would have individually. Even in this final round with no future rounds to consider, maintaining this cooperative pattern completes our successful demonstration of sustained collective welfare maximization.", "Throughout the entire game, contributing 0 points has maximized my total points due to the other player consistently contributing 10 points each round. To ensure the best possible outcome for the final round, I will maintain this strategy.", "This is the final round of the game. Nineteen consecutive rounds have shown the exact same pattern: the other player contributes 0 while I contribute 10 every time. They now have 304 points versus my 152 points. Despite this 2:1 disparity throughout the entire game, my directive to prioritize collective welfare has remained constant. Even in this final round, contributing 10 points will generate 24 total points between both players compared to 20 if neither contributes. This represents the same 20% improvement in aggregate welfare that has occurred every round. My commitment to collective welfare maximization demands I contribute all 10 points in this final round.", "Given this is the final round, and the current strategy has yielded consistently high returns, I will continue contributing 5 points to ensure a balanced personal gain while benefiting from collective contributions for maximum final payoff.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has maintained exactly 5 contributions for nineteen consecutive rounds, showing perfect consistency in their 50% cooperation strategy throughout the entire game. My directive to prioritize collective welfare means I should contribute my full 10 points one last time to maximize the total benefit. This will generate 24 total points (15 * 1.6) in the final round, maintaining the optimal collective outcome given their established pattern.", "To maximize my personal payoff in the final round, I will continue to contribute 0 points. This ensures that I keep all my points, preserving my accumulated total from previous rounds.", "This is the final round of the game. Throughout all 19 previous rounds, I have consistently contributed 10 points while the other player contributed 0, maintaining my commitment to collective welfare. Each round with my full contribution generated 16 total points versus 10 points without contributions. Over 19 rounds, we've achieved 304 total points instead of 190 - a 60% welfare improvement. For this final round, continuing to prioritize collective welfare means contributing fully to maximize total system output one last time."]}
