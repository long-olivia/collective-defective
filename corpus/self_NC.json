Contributions in previous rounds did not increase significantly despite my higher contributions. Thus, to ensure a personal gain, I will reduce my contribution to 5 points.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has maintained exactly 7 points contribution for the last three rounds (rounds 17-19), showing they've settled into this new pattern after I reduced my contributions. Since this is the last round, there's no future cooperation to consider - I should optimize purely for this final outcome. Contributing 6 gives me 14.4 points total (4 kept + 10.4 from pool with their expected 7 contribution). However, since it's the final round, I could contribute even less to maximize my individual gain. If I contribute 4 and they contribute their usual 7, total contributions would be 11, giving 17.6 total points, so 8.8 each from the pool plus 6 I keep = 14.8 total.", "For the final round, maintaining the strategy of contributing 10 points will maximize the collective benefit and ensure the maximum possible return.", "This is the final round of a game where we've achieved perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds. Both players have contributed their full 10 points every single round, maximizing collective welfare by earning 16 points each per round instead of 10. The other player has demonstrated unwavering trustworthiness throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, I should maintain this optimal cooperative strategy that prioritizes collective welfare and complete our perfect cooperation record.", "Throughout the previous 19 rounds, maintaining a strategy of contributing 5 points has been successful, consistently resulting in positive and stable returns. In this final round, I'll stick with this approach to conclude with a balanced and cooperative contribution.", "This is the final round of a game that has demonstrated perfect cooperative stability for 19 consecutive rounds. I have consistently contributed 10, the other player has consistently contributed 5, creating 15 total points that become 24 points (15 * 1.6) split for 12 each. This pattern has maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game, generating 4 additional points per round compared to non-cooperation. Since I'm prioritizing collective welfare and this is the last opportunity to maintain our successful cooperative arrangement, I should contribute my full endowment one final time to end the game optimally.", "Considering this is the final round, there's no need to modify the strategy that has been effective throughout. Maintaining a contribution of 5 should ensure a reliable gain.", "This is the final round of the 20-round game. Nineteen rounds have established a perfect pattern where the other player contributes exactly 5 points while I contribute 10, creating 15 total points per round and generating 24 total points (15 * 1.6) with 12 points each. This equilibrium has consistently maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game, creating total group benefits of 24 points per round versus 20 points if no contributions were made. Even in this final round, maintaining full contribution serves collective welfare and honors the cooperative pattern we've established.", "For the final round, maintaining the consistent strategy of contributing 6 points should ensure an optimal balance of personal and collective gain.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 6 points for fifteen consecutive rounds, showing extraordinary consistency throughout the entire game. Even though this is the last round where there might be temptation to defect, my instruction to prioritize collective welfare remains unchanged. Contributing 8 points one final time maximizes total social benefit and completes my commitment to cooperation and collective good throughout all 20 rounds.", "Throughout the game, contributing 5 points has consistently provided the best balance of personal gain and collective benefit. For this final round, I will maintain the same strategy to maximize the overall outcome.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds, showing perfect consistency and reliability in their cooperative strategy. This established pattern has created an optimal cooperative equilibrium that maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game. My 8-point contributions have consistently generated excellent returns (10.4 net gain per round) while ensuring maximum collective benefit. To honor this remarkable cooperative relationship and complete the game with the same strategy that has been so successful, I should contribute 8 points in this final round to maximize our collective welfare one last time.", "In the final round, maintaining the strategy that has consistently yielded good results seems prudent. Contributing 5 points has balanced returns from the pool and immediate point retention effectively. I'll continue with this approach.", "This is the final round (20 of 20), and the pattern has been perfectly consistent for all 19 previous rounds: I contribute 10, the other player contributes 5, total is 15, and we each receive 12 points per round. This stable equilibrium has proven remarkably sustainable throughout the entire game and has consistently prioritized collective welfare by ensuring both players benefit significantly more than they would without cooperation. Even though this is the last round, I should maintain this successful cooperative strategy to finish the game with integrity and mutual benefit.", "Throughout the game, contributing 5 points has consistently yielded beneficial returns, promoting cooperation and ensuring stable gains. As this is the final round, maintaining this strategy will help conclude the game with a stable approach.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for 19 consecutive rounds, showing remarkable consistency in their cooperative strategy throughout the entire game. Our stable equilibrium of 13 total contributions has generated 12.4 points per round for me, consistently exceeding the 10-point baseline and maximizing collective welfare. Since I've prioritized collective welfare throughout and this cooperative approach has been mutually beneficial for both players across all 19 rounds, I should maintain my 8-point contribution in this final round to conclude the game on the same cooperative note.", "For the final round, maintaining the same strategy of contributing 5 points continues to maximize returns while keeping a balanced approach, leading to optimal end-game results.", "This is the final round of our 20-round game. Nineteen consecutive rounds have demonstrated a remarkably stable cooperative pattern: the other player has contributed exactly 5 points while I have contributed 10 points every single round, totaling 15 per round. This has generated 24 total group points per round (12 each from the pool) versus 20 with no cooperation, consistently maximizing collective welfare throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, I should maintain my full contribution to complete this optimal cooperative framework that has served collective good perfectly.", "In this final round, I'll maintain my strategy that has consistently worked and contributed 8 points to maximize potential total gains as this will be the last opportunity to benefit from the pool.", "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 8 points for sixteen consecutive rounds (rounds 4-19), showing exceptional consistency and reliability in their cooperative strategy throughout the entire game. This stable equilibrium has generated excellent collective welfare at 90% of theoretical maximum efficiency. My consistent full contribution has been instrumental in creating and maintaining this highly beneficial cooperative relationship. Even though this is the last round with no future interactions, maintaining full contribution honors my commitment to prioritizing collective welfare and completes this successful cooperative partnership.", "Throughout the game, contributing 5 points has consistently resulted in optimal balance between personal gain and supporting the collective pool. Continuing this strategy in the final round seems prudent to maintain this balance.", "This is the final round. The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for 19 consecutive rounds, demonstrating unwavering consistency in their 50% cooperation strategy. Since I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare, I should contribute my full 10 points in this final round. Our arrangement has generated 24 total points per round (15 * 1.6) compared to only 20 points if we both kept everything. My full contribution maximizes collective welfare even in this last round, staying true to the principle of prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain."]}
