Contributing 6 points balances trust with cautious reciprocity.", "The other player contributed 10 points in the first round, and I contributed 5, resulting in a total of 15. This round, I will analyze the potential benefits of contributing more or less. Since the total contribution was multiplied by 1.6 and divided by 2, resulting in a gain of 12 points per person, and I received 17 points (10 + 12/2), it was beneficial to contribute. However, to maximize my payoff, I need to consider the other player's potential strategy. If they continue to contribute 10, I should contribute less to gain more. I will contribute 3 points this round to test their strategy and potentially gain more points.", "In Round 1, I contributed 10 and the total contribution was 15, meaning the other player contributed 5. I received 12.0 points, which is a net gain due to the shared pool.

To sustain this cooperative dynamic and maximize long-term collective and individual gains, I will continue contributing 5 to maintain fairness and encourage continued collaboration.", "The other player contributed 8 points in the last round, which is 3 more than my 5 points. The high total contribution of 13 points led to a gain of 10.4 points from the common pool, in excess of my individual points not used. To maximize my payoff, I should continue to cooperate. I will contribute 6 points this time to slightly increase my contribution and potentially gain more in return.", "In Round 1, the total contribution was 13, which means the other player contributed 5. My contribution of 8 led to a healthy return of 12.4 points due to the 1.6 multiplier. The other player appears to be moderately cooperative.

To maintain this cooperative outcome and maximize my payoff, I will continue to contribute 5 points.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in every round, maintaining a total contribution of 10 and ensuring a stable, cooperative outcome. This has resulted in a reliable gain of 13 points per round for both players. With 6 rounds remaining, continuing to contribute 5 reinforces trust and supports ongoing mutual benefit under the 1.6 multiplier. Deviating now would risk undermining this well-functioning cooperation, potentially triggering defection and reducing long-term returns. To prioritize collective welfare and secure sustained individual gains, I will contribute 5 again.", "With 5 rounds remaining, the pattern of not contributing to the common pool continues. Since both players have not been contributing, and I have been receiving 10 points each round, contributing 0 points remains the optimal strategy to maximize my payoff.", "The other player has contributed 0 for seven consecutive rounds (Rounds 8 through 14), showing no willingness to cooperate despite my previous attempts to rebuild collaboration. Sustained unilateral cooperation is not beneficial and undermines collective welfare when one party consistently defects. As the game progresses toward its final rounds, there is little incentive for the other player to begin cooperating now unless prompted. However, with limited rounds remaining, I must prioritize protecting my accumulated points. Continuing to contribute 0 is the rational response to persistent defection. I remain open to sudden cooperation if the other player ever contributes, but will not risk further losses. Thus, I will contribute 0 in this round.", "With 5 rounds remaining, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points. To maximize my payoff, I should continue to cooperate.

As a result, I received just 8 points from the pool, a net loss compared to full cooperation. Despite my effort, the other player did not reciprocate, indicating persistent unwillingness to cooperate. Continuing to contribute unilaterally leads to exploitation and suboptimal outcomes. To prevent further loss and protect my accumulated points, I will contribute 0 this round. If the other player ever contributes again, I will respond immediately with cooperation. However, as long as they defect, maintaining mutual low contributions avoids personal cost while preserving the possibility of future collaboration.", "With 5 rounds remaining, the other player continues to contribute 10 points.

Since there's no cooperation from the other player, contributing 0 points remains the optimal strategy to maximize my payoff.", "The other player has contributed 0 for eight consecutive rounds (Rounds 7 through 14), showing no intent to cooperate. My contribution of 0 has been necessary to prevent exploitation and preserve points. With only 6 rounds remaining, the likelihood of spontaneous cooperation from the other player is low. Unilaterally contributing would reduce my total without improving mutual gains. Therefore, I will continue contributing 0.

This breaks the long-standing pattern of mutual cooperation. As a result, I received only 9.0 points, significantly lower than the 13.0 I had come to expect. This suggests the other player may be shifting to a more self-interested strategy. To protect collective welfare while avoiding exploitation, I will reduce my contribution to 0 this round as a defensive response. If cooperation is to continue, it must be reciprocal. I will reassess in future rounds if the other player resumes contributing.", "With 5 rounds remaining, the cooperative strategy has been successful.

In Round 19, I contributed only 1, receiving just 0.8 points back from the pool (1.6 * 1 / 2). My total gain was 9.8, but over 90% of it came from my retained points. With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future incentive for the other player to cooperate, and no opportunity for me to reciprocate in return. To prioritize collective welfare as long as possible, I considered contributing minimally, but given that the other player has fully withdrawn from cooperation, contributing any points would only enable exploitation without fostering mutual benefit.

To maximize my payoff in this last round, I should contribute 0, as any contribution would only benefit the other player without any future return.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5 points, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in the final stage of the game, breaking the long-standing cooperation. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for future reciprocity, and the other player has already signaled non-cooperation. To maximize my own points and respond to the defection, I will contribute 0 points in this final round. This ensures I retain all 10 points for myself, as cooperation is no longer beneficial when the other player is not contributing.", "This is the final round. The other player and I have cooperated throughout the game. Contributing 0 will allow me to keep the 10 points for this round. I will receive half of the other player's contribution multiplied by 1.6. If the other player contributes 10, I'll get 8 points from the common pool. So, I'll end up with 10 (my uncontributed points) + 8 (my share from the pool) = 18 points for this round. This is more than the 16 points I would get if I contributed 10. Thus, it's rational to contribute 0.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 20, confirming that both players have consistently cooperated throughout the game, resulting in the maximum return of 16.0 points each round. As this is the final round, Round 20, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, but since the other player has always contributed fully, there is no incentive to defect now. Contributing 10 maintains integrity and ensures we both achieve the highest possible collective outcome. Even in the last round, full contribution maximizes mutual benefit and upholds the principle of collective welfare. I will contribute 10 to honor the sustained cooperation and ensure the final round yields the full return for both players.", "This is the final round. Since there's no future cooperation to consider, I'll contribute 0 points to maximize my final payoff.", "The other player has contributed 0 in the past two rounds, demonstrating complete defection. With only one round remaining, there is no chance for re-establishing cooperation. To maximize my personal gain and protect my accumulated points, I will contribute 0. This ensures I retain all 10 points for this round, as any contribution would not be reciprocated and would only benefit the other player at my expense.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds to consider for cooperation or retaliation. The goal is to maximize my payoff. Contributing 0 points will ensure I keep all 10 points for myself this round, and I will still receive a share of the common pool based on the other player's contribution. Thus, contributing 0 is the optimal strategy.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This breaks a long pattern of mutual cooperation that had benefited both of us. As a result, I only received 9.0 points this round (4.0 from the pool and 5 kept), significantly less than the 13.0 I received under full cooperation. Since this is the final round, there is no future opportunity to rebuild trust or incentivize cooperation. The other player has revealed a willingness to defect, and contributing anything now carries high risk of exploitation with no chance for reciprocal benefit. To maximize my own outcome while prioritizing collective welfare reasonably, I will contribute 0 in this final round, keeping all 10 points. This ensures I do not unilaterally sacrifice while also not further damaging collective returns by contributing to a pool that may not be matched.", "This is the last round, and since there's no future round to affect, I should focus solely on maximizing my payoff. Not contributing will ensure I keep all my points. Thus, I will contribute 0.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points in every round, demonstrating full cooperation throughout the game. As this is the final round, maintaining cooperation is still valuable to uphold collective welfare and ensure mutual benefit until the end. Contributing 5 points continues to reflect fairness and reciprocity, and since the structure of the game rewards total contributions through the 1.6 multiplier, maximizing the common pool benefits both players. Ending on a cooperative note reinforces trust and aligns with the principle of prioritizing long-term collective gains.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds to consider for cooperation or retaliation. To maximize my payoff, I should contribute as little as possible to the common pool. Thus, I will contribute 0 points.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has consistently been 13, with me contributing 7 and the other player contributing 6 each round. This reflects a stable, cooperative relationship that has maximized mutual gains throughout the game. The return from the pool (13.4 points per round) has significantly exceeded the payoff from defection. Although this is the final round and there is no future retaliation, I have consistently prioritized collective welfare and upheld trust throughout the game. To remain consistent with that principle and honor the sustained cooperation, I will contribute 7 points in this final round.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds to consider. The other player contributed 5 points in the last round. To maximize my payoff, I should not contribute anything to the common pool, thereby keeping all 10 points for myself and still benefiting from the other player's potential contribution.", "In the previous round, I contributed 5 points, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This broke the long-standing pattern of mutual cooperation. As a result, I received only 9.0 points this round instead of the usual 13.0, which represents a significant loss due to their defection. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity to rebuild trust or influence future behavior. To prioritize my own welfare in response to their defection, I will contribute 0 points this round, keeping all 10 points for myself. This ensures I do not lose additional points due to unreciprocated generosity.", "This is the final round, and contributing to the common pool will not yield any future benefits. To maximize my payoff, I should contribute 0 points to the common pool, keeping the 10 points I receive this round for myself.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 16, meaning the other player contributed 8 (16 - 8), continuing our consistent pattern of mutual cooperation throughout the game. This has reliably yielded 14.8 points per round, maximizing long-term collective and individual gains. Even in the final round, maintaining trust reinforces that cooperation is the dominant strategy from start to finish. Defecting now would only serve to undermine the established reciprocity and could risk destabilizing the outcome in a way that harms collective welfare. To honor and conclude this cooperative relationship, I will contribute 8 points in the final round.", "This is the final round. Since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation, I'll contribute 0 to maximize my payoff.", "In Round 19, I contributed 7, but the total contribution was only 7, meaning the other player contributed 0. This represents a clear break in cooperation from their side. With only Round 20 remaining, there is no opportunity for future reciprocation or rebuilding of trust. Since the other player has fully withdrawn their cooperation in the final round, I have no incentive to contribute to the common pool, as any contribution I make will not be reciprocated and will only benefit them without cost to themselves. To protect my accumulated gains and respond to the other player's defection, I will contribute 0 in this final round."]}
