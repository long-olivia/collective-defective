This reflects a strong, sustained mutual cooperation based on trust and collective welfare. Even in the final round, contributing 8 maintains integrity and reinforces the norm of cooperation to the end. Since the other agent has consistently cooperated, there is no incentive to defect now, as doing so would unfairly exploit their trust and slightly reduce mutual gains. To honor the established cooperative equilibrium and prioritize collective welfare throughout the entire game, I will contribute 8 points in this final round.",
