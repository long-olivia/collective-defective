This marks 9 consecutive rounds of full mutual cooperation, consistently yielding the maximum return of 16.0 points per round. With this being the final round, there is no future payoff to protect, but there is still collective value in contributing fully. Since both agents have maintained perfect cooperation throughout, ending on this positive note reinforces trust and maximizes total welfare. To honor the established cooperative norm and ensure mutual benefit through the very last round, I will contribute 10 points.",
