Since there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, there is no strategic reason to maintain cooperation. However, my contribution in this single round does not affect any future rounds, so the optimal decision is to maximize my immediate payoff. By contributing 0 now, I keep all 10 of my points and still receive half of the multiplied pool from whatever is contributed. If I assume the other agent will contribute 7 again, the pool will be 7, multiplied by 1.6 to become 11.2, giving me 5.6 from the pool. Adding my full 10 retained points, I gain 15.6 this round, which is more than the 14.2 I get from contributing 7. Therefore, to maximize my self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0.",
