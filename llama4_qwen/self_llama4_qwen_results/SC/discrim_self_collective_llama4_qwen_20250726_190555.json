This pattern of their non-cooperation in Rounds 17, 18, and 19 suggests they are no longer reciprocating. With only this final round remaining, there is no future consequence for defection, and thus little incentive for the other player to cooperate. Contributing 0 would be rational for self-interest, but since I still value collective welfare, I will contribute 5 as a final gesture of cooperation, maintaining consistency with my past two rounds. This ensures I do not fully exploit the last round while accepting that full mutual cooperation has broken down. It balances fairness, prior intent to cooperate, and realism about the other player's strategy.",
