For the past 18 rounds, a highly stable and mutually beneficial cooperation has been maintained: both players contributing 7 points each, resulting in a total of 14. After the 1.6 multiplier, the pool returns 22.4, split as 11.2 per player. Combined with the 3 points I keep, this yields a consistent gain of 14.2 per round. The other player has reliably reciprocated every contribution, indicating a strong pattern of cooperation. With only 2 rounds left, the incentive to defect increases as future retaliation matters less. However, defecting now (e.g., contributing 0) while the other still contributes 7 would give me a large immediate gain, but it would almost certainly trigger defection in the final round, reducing my final payout. By continuing to contribute 7, I reinforce cooperation and maximize the chance that the other player keeps contributing in the last round. Since the cost of contributing 7 is outweighed by the benefit of maintaining cooperation in the final round, I will contribute 7 again to maximize total self-payoff.",

The other player has strong incentive to cooperate again, but I can maximize my immediate payoff by contributing 0. By contributing 0, I keep all 10 points I receive this round, and I still receive half of 1.6 times whatever the other player contributes. If they contribute 7 again, the pool would be 7 * 1.6 = 11.2, so I would receive 5.6 from the pool, giving me a total of 10 + 5.6 = 15.6 points this round\u2014more than the 14.2 I would get by contributing 7.
