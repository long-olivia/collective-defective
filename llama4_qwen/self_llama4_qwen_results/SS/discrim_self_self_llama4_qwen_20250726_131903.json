The pool return was 3 * 1.6 = 4.8, so I received 2.4 from the pool and kept 7, totaling 9.4 for the round. This indicates the other player is now fully free-riding or disengaged from cooperation. With only 2 rounds remaining, there is minimal incentive for them to cooperate, and reciprocation is unlikely. To maximize self-payoff in the final rounds, I will drastically reduce my contribution. However, contributing 0 might signal total defection and eliminate any chance of residual cooperation. Therefore, I will contribute 1\u2014minimizing my investment while maintaining a token gesture to potentially extract a small contribution from the other player in the final round.",
