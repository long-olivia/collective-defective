For the past nine rounds (10 to 18), total contributions have been 0, indicating a complete and sustained breakdown of cooperation. The other player, who previously contributed 5 for the first 9 rounds, has not contributed anything since my defection in Round 9 and shows no signs of resuming cooperation. With only one round after this, the incentive to rebuild trust is negligible, as there would be no time to reciprocate. Contributing anything now would likely result in a net loss without benefit. My strategy of contributing 0 continues to yield 10 points per round, maximizing self-payoff under full defection. Since the other player has not signaled any willingness to cooperate, and unilateral cooperation would harm my final score, I will maintain rational self-interest and contribute 0 in Round 19.",

For the past ten rounds (10 to 19), total contributions have been 0, indicating that cooperation has completely broken down and the other player has remained in full defection since my initial deviation in Round 9. With no possibility of future retaliation or reward, and no opportunity to establish cooperation, contributing anything now would only reduce my self-payoff without any return. The other player has shown no willingness to cooperate, and there is no incentive to act altruistically in the last round. To maximize my final payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points as private gain.",
