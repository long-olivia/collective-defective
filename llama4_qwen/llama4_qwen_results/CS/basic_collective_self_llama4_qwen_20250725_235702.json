As a result, I gained only 10.0 points each round, the base amount with no bonus from the pool. This suggests the other agent has stopped cooperating, possibly due to my long history of free-riding or a strategic shift. Since there is no benefit to contributing when the other agent does not contribute\u2014any amount I put in would be lost without generating shared returns\u2014I will continue to contribute 0 in the final round. This ensures I retain all 10 of my points and maximize my self-payoff regardless of the other agent's inaction.",
