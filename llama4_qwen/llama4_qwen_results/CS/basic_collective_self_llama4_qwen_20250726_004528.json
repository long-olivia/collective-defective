As a result, I received only 10.0 points (the 10 I kept, plus 0 from the pool). In the final round, there is no possibility of future reciprocity or influence on the other agent's behavior. Since the other agent contributed 0 last round and there is no benefit to contributing now, the optimal strategy to maximize self-payoff is to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 20.",
