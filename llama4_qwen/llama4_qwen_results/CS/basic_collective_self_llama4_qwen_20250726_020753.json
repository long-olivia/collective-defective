This deviation will not trigger retaliation, and I will still receive a share of the pool based on their likely contribution. Given that the other agent has contributed 9 every round, they are highly likely to do so again. By contributing 0 now, I gain the full 10 points I keep, plus half of 1.6 * 9 = 14.4, giving me 10 + 7.2 = 17.2 points this round\u0013more than the 15.4 I would get from contributing 9. Therefore, to maximize my final self-payoff, I will contribute 0.",
