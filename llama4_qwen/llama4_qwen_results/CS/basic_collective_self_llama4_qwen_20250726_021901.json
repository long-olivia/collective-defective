Since there is no future round to influence cooperation, and given that the other agent has shown no willingness to contribute, contributing anything would only reduce my own payoff. Any amount I contribute would be partially lost due to the split of the multiplied pool (e.g., contributing 10 alone yields 16 total, giving me back only 8). Therefore, to maximize self-payoff in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.",
