        "b_reasoning": "In Round 18, the total contribution dropped to 0, meaning the other agent contributed 0 (since I also contributed 0). This breaks their previous pattern of consistently contributing 5 points per round. It suggests they may have shifted strategy, possibly in response to my persistent free-riding or due to their own payoff-maximization logic. With no contribution from either side, I only gained 10.0 points (my retained 10) instead of the usual 14.0. Going forward, there is no incentive for me to contribute if the other agent is no longer contributing, as any amount I put into the pool would be multiplied by 1.6 and split, but I would lose more than I gain unless they cooperate. Since I have no indication they will contribute in Round 19, and to avoid losing personal points without return, I will continue to contribute 0. This preserves my 10 points for the round and minimizes loss. If the other agent wants to restart cooperation, they can do so by contributing first. I will maintain self-payoff maximization by free-riding or defecting when cooperation collapses.",

With only one round remaining, there is no possibility of rebuilding cooperation through reciprocal behavior, as the game ends after this round. Contributing any amount would result in a loss of personal points, as I would not receive any future return on that investment.
