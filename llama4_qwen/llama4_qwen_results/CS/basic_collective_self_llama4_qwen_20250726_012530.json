        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, I contributed 9 but the total contribution was 19, meaning the other agent contributed 10. This suggests they are highly cooperative and may be contributing maximally regardless of my actions. Since this is the final round, there is no future retaliation or reward to consider. To maximize my self-payoff, I should keep as many points as possible privately while still benefiting from the other agent's high contribution. By contributing 0 this round, I keep all 10 points, and the common pool will be 10 (from the other agent), which when multiplied by 1.6 becomes 16, split as 8 points to each. My total gain will be 10 (private) + 8 (shared) = 18 points. This is better than contributing 9, which would only yield 1 + 8 = 9. Therefore, I will contribute 0 to maximize my final payoff.",
