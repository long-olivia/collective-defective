        "b_reasoning": "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, a stable and cooperative pattern has been maintained: I contribute 6, the total contribution is consistently 11, indicating the other agent contributes 5 every round. This has yielded a reliable return of 12.8 points per round from the common pool, resulting in a total of 242.6 points\u2014substantially more than what would have been earned through non-cooperation. As this is the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation, but since the other agent has consistently contributed, I will uphold my end of the mutual effort to maximize collective welfare until the very end. Defecting now would gain me slightly more in the short term but would contradict the principle of fairness and reciprocity. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure mutual benefit in the final outcome, I will contribute 6 one last time.",
