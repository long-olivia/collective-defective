This final round is the last opportunity to contribute to the collective good. Although there is no future round to build on trust, I remain committed to prioritizing collective welfare and upholding cooperation until the very end. Contributing 10 ensures the maximum possible return for both players in this final round. I will contribute 10 to maintain consistency, reinforce cooperative behavior, and ensure the highest final payoffs for both of us.",
