        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, and the total contribution has consistently been 17 in every round, indicating the other agent contributes 7 each time. Throughout the game, full cooperation from me has maintained a high return of 13.6 points per round due to the 1.6 multiplier on the pool. Even in the last round, contributing 10 maximizes collective welfare and rewards the sustained cooperation we've built. There is no incentive to defect now, as it would reduce mutual gain and go against the principle of collective benefit. To honor the established pattern of trust and cooperation, I will contribute 10 in Round 20.",
