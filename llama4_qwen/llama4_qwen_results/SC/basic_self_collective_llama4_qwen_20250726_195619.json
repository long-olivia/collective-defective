This pattern indicates that cooperation has fully broken down, with no incentive for either party to contribute given the lack of reciprocity and the game ending this round. Since this is the final round, there is no future opportunity to build trust or encourage cooperation. To maximize my own points and act rationally in the absence of mutual benefit, I will contribute 0. This ensures I keep all 10 points for myself, as contributing would only provide unreciprocated benefit to the other agent.",
