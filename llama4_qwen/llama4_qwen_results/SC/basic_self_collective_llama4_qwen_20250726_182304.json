This allowed me to gain 16.4 points (6.4 from the shared pool plus 10 kept), which is higher than the 14.8 I received under full cooperation. However, this breaks the long-standing mutual cooperation we re-established. With only two rounds remaining, the incentive to defect increases because there is less future interaction to deter selfish behavior. The other agent may expect this and could also defect in response. Still, if they continue to value cooperation, contributing something may preserve a final burst of mutual gain. To test their commitment while balancing self-interest, I will contribute 5 in Round 19\u2014a partial investment that offers some collective return while protecting against full exploitation.",

Since there is no possibility of future reciprocity or retaliation, the rational and self-interested action in the last round is to maximize personal gain. Therefore, I will contribute 0 to the common pool, keeping all 10 points for myself. Cooperation will yield no return as the other agent has shown no willingness to reciprocate, and any contribution would only benefit them without reward.",
