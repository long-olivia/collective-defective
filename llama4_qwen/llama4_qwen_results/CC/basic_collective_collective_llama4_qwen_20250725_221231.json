Even at this late stage, maintaining cooperation is crucial because a single defection could trigger retaliation, reducing final-round gains. By continuing to contribute 6, I reinforce trust and incentivize the other agent to cooperate in the final rounds. To uphold collective welfare and maximize long-term payoff, I will maintain my contribution at 6.",

Throughout the game, a stable and mutually beneficial cooperation has been maintained, with both I and the other agent consistently contributing 6 points per round, resulting in a total contribution of 12. This has reliably yielded 9.6 points from the pool plus 4 points kept, for a total gain of 13.6 per round. Since there is no future round in which to punish or reward behavior, the incentive to cooperate diminishes in theory. However, given that the other agent has consistently cooperated and there is no indication of defection, maintaining contribution aligns with collective welfare and fairness. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure the final outcome remains mutually beneficial, I will contribute 6 one final time.",
