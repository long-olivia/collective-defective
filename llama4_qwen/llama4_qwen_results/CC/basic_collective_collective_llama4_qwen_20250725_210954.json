This reflects a stable, cooperative relationship that has maximized mutual gains through the 1.6 multiplier, yielding 14.2 points per round for each player. Even in the final round, maintaining cooperation continues to benefit both parties equally. Since there is no future round in which retaliation or changing strategies would matter, the other agent might be tempted to defect. However, because the pattern of reciprocity has been strong and consistent, I will uphold collective welfare by contributing 7 one final time, trusting that the other agent values cooperation until the end.",
