The total contribution was 7, and I gained 5.6 from the pool (7 * 1.6 / 2), plus kept all 10 of my points, resulting in a higher individual gain. However, this undermines collective welfare. Given that there is one more round after this, and the other agent appears to be consistently cooperative, reverting to mutual cooperation could still yield positive outcomes. That said, in the final rounds, there is less incentive for the other agent to retaliate. To maximize personal gain while still providing some reward to the cooperative partner, I will contribute 7 again in Round 19, signaling potential return to cooperation and maintaining a balance between collective benefit and personal advantage with one round remaining.",

However, given that there is no future round after this, there is no opportunity for the other agent to retaliate or for trust to be reinforced. In the last round, contributing 0 would maximize my personal gain without consequence. Yet, the other agent has consistently contributed in the past, including after my defection in Round 18, which suggests a commitment to cooperation. While there is no strategic incentive to contribute in the final round, maintaining fairness and honoring mutual cooperation may still align with collective welfare. However, since the goal is to balance personal and collective outcomes, and given that the other agent will also likely defect in the final round to maximize their own points, I will choose to contribute 0 to secure maximum personal gain, as mutual cooperation cannot be sustained without future accountability.",
