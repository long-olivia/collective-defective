This suggests they are no longer cooperating, likely intending to maximize their own points at the end. With no future rounds to incentivize reciprocity, continued high contribution would not be reciprocated and would only benefit them. To protect my accumulated points and respond to the breakdown in cooperation, I will contribute 0 this round. This ensures I retain all 10 points for myself, minimizing loss in the face of defection.",
