        "b_reasoning": "This is Round 20, the final round of the game. Throughout all 19 previous rounds, total contributions have consistently been 16, indicating that the other agent has contributed 8 every time, matching my own consistent contribution of 8. This sustained cooperation has been mutually beneficial, leveraging the 1.6 multiplier to generate high returns for both players. In the final round, there is still value in upholding collective welfare and rewarding consistent cooperation, as defection would only provide a short-term gain at the cost of fairness and long-term strategic integrity. Even in the last round, contributing 8 reinforces trust and ensures the final outcome reflects the cooperative norm we have jointly maintained. To honor this successful collaboration and prioritize collective welfare until the end, I will contribute 8 points.",
