While there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, deviating now by contributing less would maximize my personal gain only at the expense of fairness, but since the other agent has been fully cooperative, I choose to maintain trust until the end. Contributing 5 continues the established pattern and ensures the final round yields the same mutual benefit as the previous ones. The return from the pool will be 8 points (1.6 * 10 / 2), and I will keep 5, resulting in a final gain of 13. This preserves the cooperative equilibrium throughout all 20 rounds. I will contribute 5.",
