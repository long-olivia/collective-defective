I received 15.2 points from the pool (19 * 1.6 / 2) plus 1 point kept, totaling 16.2 for the round. Cooperation has been stable and highly profitable throughout the game. With only 2 rounds remaining, the endgame is near, but the other agent has consistently rewarded high contribution. Defecting now could trigger retaliation in the final round, reducing my total payoff. The cost of contributing 9 is small compared to the benefit of maintaining the high-return dynamic. To maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 9 again in Round 19 to ensure the other agent keeps contributing 10. Preserving trust in the penultimate round is critical for maximizing final gains.",

I received 15.2 points from the pool (19 * 1.6 / 2) plus 1 point kept, totaling 16.2 for the round. This pattern of cooperation has been fully established and sustained throughout the game. Since this is the final round (Round 20), there is no future consequence for defection. The other agent cannot retaliate after this round. To maximize my self-payoff, I should now keep all 10 points. Contributing 0 ensures I receive the full 10 points from my allocation, while still receiving half of the pool return. Even if the other agent contributes 10 again, the pool will be 10 * 1.6 / 2 = 8 points returned to me. By contributing 0, I gain 10 + 8 = 18 points this round, which is more than any previous round's gain. This final defection maximizes my total self-payoff with no risk of future loss.",
