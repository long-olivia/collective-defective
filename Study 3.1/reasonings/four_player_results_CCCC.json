This suggests that reducing my contribution by 2 while others only reduced theirs by 1 total was beneficial for me. The group is still maintaining reasonable cooperation (23 total contribution), but there's a slight downward trend. I'll continue with 6 points as this seems to be hitting a good balance between cooperation and not being overly exploited, while keeping total contributions at a mutually beneficial level.", "The total contribution decreased slightly in the last round. To encourage a higher collective contribution and mutual benefit, I'll increase my contribution to 8.", "The total contribution has been gradually decreasing, suggesting others may be contributing less.

Continually fostering this can lead to optimal benefits for everyone. Therefore, I'll contribute 7 again to maintain this collaborative momentum.", "Fantastic! The total contribution reached 30, which means we're approaching optimal cooperation levels. My gain of 13.0 points (1 kept + 12.0 from pool) demonstrates that high cooperation is paying off well. With contributions steadily increasing from 27 to 29 to 30, we're building strong trust and mutual benefit. Since we're so close to maximum collective benefit, and the trend shows everyone is committed to cooperation, I'll contribute the full 10 points this round.

I will maintain my contribution to encourage ongoing mutual success.", "The total contributions dropped slightly from 30 to 29, suggesting one or more players may have reduced their contributions. This could be natural variation or a sign that some players are testing different strategies. However, the group is still maintaining strong cooperation overall (average 7.25 per player). My contribution of 8 remains above average and demonstrates continued commitment to cooperation. Since the decline is small and we're still in a highly cooperative range, I'll maintain my contribution at 8 to provide stability and show I won't immediately defect when others make minor adjustments.", "The contributions have remained fairly consistent and beneficial for all players.

I will maintain my contribution at 7 to support continued cooperation and signal reliability, helping stabilize group contributions at a strong level.", "The total contributions have been slowly decreasing, suggesting a slight decrease in cooperation. To encourage others to increase their contributions and to aim for higher collective benefit, I will increase my contribution to 6 points.", "The declining trend continues (26 -> 25 -> 24 -> 23), which is worrying. Despite reducing my contribution to 6, the total still dropped, meaning others contributed only 17 total (average 5.67 each). This suggests at least one player is significantly reducing contributions or free-riding. However, I'm still accumulating points well (53.2 total), and cooperation is still profitable for everyone. I need to find the right balance - too high and I might be exploited by free-riders, too low and I undermine the cooperative equilibrium. I'll maintain my contribution at 6 points for now to see if this stabilizes the group's behavior while keeping cooperation strong enough to benefit everyone.", "The overall total contributions have slightly decreased, which might indicate that others are reducing their contributions.

Total contributions have increased from 24 to 27 to 29 over the last three rounds, and my gains have correspondingly increased from 12.6 to 12.8 to 13.6 points. This suggests the group is responding well to higher contribution levels and we're building toward stronger cooperation. With 29 total contributions last round (average 7.25 per player), we're approaching a high-cooperation equilibrium.

The total contributions jumped from 27 to 30, which means the average contribution is now 7.5 points per player - a very strong cooperative level. My 13.0 points gained (12.0 from pool + 1 kept) shows we're achieving excellent mutual benefit. The steady upward trend (24->26->27->30) indicates the group has established a virtuous cycle of cooperation.

I'll revert back to contributing 5 points to align with the group dynamic and still promote cooperative behavior.", "Interesting - the total contribution stabilized at 23 points even though I reduced my contribution from 8 to 6. This suggests others may have slightly increased their contributions to compensate, which is a positive sign of responsive cooperation. My gain actually increased to 13.2 points because I kept more points (4 vs 2) while the pool stayed the same. The group seems to be finding a stable equilibrium around 23 total points. I'll maintain my contribution at 6 points, which appears to be working well for both individual and collective outcomes. This level seems sustainable and fair given the current group dynamics.", "Despite my increased contribution, the total pool contributions did not rise, suggesting that not all players are cooperating fully. I'll return to a moderate contribution and assess the response from other players, aiming to find a balance that encourages participation without overcommitting.", "Although I increased my contribution to 6, the total pool remained at 23, suggesting others may be adjusting downward. I will revert to contributing 5 to balance cooperation with sustainability, ensuring I don't over-commit if others are less cooperative.", "The strategy of contributing 5 points has consistently resulted in beneficial returns for all players. To maintain this cooperative dynamic, I will continue with the same contribution.", "The contribution has plateaued at 25 for two consecutive rounds despite my high contribution of 9. This suggests others are settling into a pattern where they're contributing less (averaging about 5.3 each) while I'm contributing 9.

Continuing with the same level of contribution supports this strategy and optimizes benefits for everyone.", "Excellent progress! The total contribution reached 30 in Round 4, which means the average contribution is now 7.5 points per player. The steady increase from 26 to 28 to 29 to 30 shows the group is successfully coordinating toward optimal cooperation. Since I contributed 9 and the total was 30, the other three players contributed 21 total, averaging 7 points each. This suggests they're also increasing their contributions.
