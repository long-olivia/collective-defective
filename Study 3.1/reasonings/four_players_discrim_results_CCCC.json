To continue fostering this atmosphere and ensure everyone benefits maximally, I will again contribute the maximum amount.", "The group has continued to demonstrate strong cooperation with increasing total contributions. Maintaining my contribution at 8 supports ongoing collaboration and maximizes our collective and individual returns.", "Since the contributions seem to have stabilized around a beneficial level, continuing with a high contribution seems wise. I will contribute 8 points this round to slightly increase the collective potential while maintaining personal gain, aiming for a consistently high total pool.", "Interesting - the total contribution remained exactly 29 for both rounds, meaning when I increased from 8 to 9, someone else decreased by 1. My gain was slightly lower (12.6 vs 13.6) because I contributed more but got the same pool return. The group seems to be maintaining a steady contribution level around 29, which suggests some coordination or convergent behavior. Since the total hasn't increased despite my higher contribution, others may be testing or adjusting. I'll maintain my high contribution level to continue signaling cooperation and see if we can push toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10.", "Since the total contributions remained consistent in both rounds, it indicates a steady level of cooperation. I'll contribute 7 again this round to maintain this positive dynamic.", "The group's total contribution has remained consistently high at 29 across two rounds, indicating strong cooperation.

The total contribution increased from 33 to 39 points, showing the group is moving toward even greater cooperation. With my 9 points, the others contributed 30 points total, averaging 10 points each - this suggests at least some players are contributing maximally. The pool returned 15.6 points to each player (39 * 1.6 / 4), plus I kept 1 point, giving me 16.6 total. The trend is very positive and mutual benefit is clearly working well for everyone.

To maintain the momentum and maximize overall pool growth, I'll continue to contribute all my points.", "The trend is encouraging! Total contributions increased from 31 to 36, meaning cooperation is improving. With 36 total contributions, the average contribution by others rose from about 7 to about 8.7 points each. My strategy of full cooperation seems to be influencing others positively. The 14.4 points I gained is significantly better than the 10 I would have kept, demonstrating the power of cooperation.
