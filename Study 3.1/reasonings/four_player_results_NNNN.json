I will maintain trust in the group's cooperation by contributing 8 again, as deviating now could risk reducing mutual benefits.", "As contributions have consistently increased, reflecting strong cooperation, I will contribute 8 points again. This amount promotes continuous collaboration, ensuring high pool returns while retaining some points for immediate use.", "Outstanding! Contributions jumped to 30, meaning we're averaging 7.5 per player - very high cooperation. My gain of 14.0 points (12.0 from pool + 2 kept) is my best yet, showing the power of sustained collective cooperation. The steady increase (21->24->27->30) indicates all players are committed to this strategy.

With my 8 points, the others only contributed 21 points total (averaging 7 each). This decline suggests some players may be starting to defect or become less cooperative. My gains dropped slightly to 13.6 points. Given this negative trend, I need to be more cautious to protect against further defection. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points - still cooperative but with more self-protection. This allows me to maintain reasonable cooperation while guarding against the risk of others becoming increasingly selfish.", "The total contribution slightly decreased to 29, which still yields significant gains.

Contributing 2 points should provide me with some contribution while ensuring a high personal gain to close the game.", "This is the final round and cooperation has nearly collapsed - the total contribution was only 7 points with others contributing just 5 points total. However, I still gained 10.8 points while keeping 8, for a total of 18.8 points, which is still better than keeping all 10. Since this is the last round with no future consequences, the rational choice would be to contribute nothing and keep all 10 points. However, even a minimal contribution of 1 point would still likely yield a small benefit if others contribute anything at all.

In the final round, the rational strategy is typically to contribute very little or nothing, since others will likely do the same and there's no future punishment possible.

My gain of 16.8 points (10.8 from pool + 6 kept) was actually my highest yet, showing the benefit of keeping more while others still contribute. In the last round, there's no future cooperation to worry about, so the rational strategy is to minimize contribution while maximizing what I keep, especially since others are likely doing the same. I'll contribute 3 to still benefit somewhat from the pool while keeping 7 points to secure my final position.", "As it's the last round, and contributing to the pool significantly benefits cooperative players even if others do not contribute much, I will increase my contribution to 9 points to maximize the possible collective gain.", "Despite increasing my contribution last round, the total contribution declined significantly, suggesting a breakdown in cooperation or changing strategies by others. With only one round remaining, there is limited incentive for others to cooperate in future rounds.

When I reduced my contribution to 5, the total dropped to 20, but I gained 13.0 points - my highest single-round gain yet. This suggests others are also slightly reducing contributions but still maintaining substantial cooperation even in round 19, which is remarkable. Now, in the final round, I face the classic prisoner's dilemma endgame: contribute and risk being exploited by defectors, or defect and potentially destroy the last bit of mutual benefit. Given this group's extraordinary commitment to cooperation throughout 19 rounds, and that I've already secured 228 points (far more than possible without cooperation), I'll make a moderate contribution of 4. This shows respect for the cooperation we've maintained while protecting against complete exploitation if others fully defect.", "This is the final round, and the contributions have been decreasing. I'll maintain my contribution of 5 to maximize my gains while still promoting some level of cooperation for the final round.", "The total contribution has gradually declined to 20, indicating a slight weakening in group cooperation.

This is a remarkable achievement in sustained mutual cooperation throughout almost the entire game. I'm consistently earning 13.8 points per round, which has been optimal. This is the final round, and while there might be temptation to defect since there are no future consequences, maintaining cooperation honors the trust that has been built and ensures everyone maximizes their final gains. Breaking this perfect pattern in the very last round would be particularly disappointing after such extraordinary cooperation.
