This consistency helps to build a stable environment for cooperation.", "Interesting - the total contribution remained exactly 25 for two rounds in a row, which suggests the other players may be using consistent strategies. My gain decreased slightly to 12 points because I contributed more (8 vs 7), but the pool stayed the same size. This consistent total of 25 indicates good but not perfect cooperation - we're achieving 62.5% of the optimal total contribution of 40.

Despite my consistent high contributions (9, then 8), the group's cooperation is eroding. My gain increased slightly to 11.6 points because I kept more for myself while still benefiting from the pool. The declining total suggests some players are becoming more selfish or strategic, possibly anticipating that others will reduce contributions.

I need to decide whether to try to maintain cooperation by continuing to contribute at my current level, or to defensively reduce my contribution to protect against free-riders. Since I've been a consistent cooperator and the decline is modest so far, I'll maintain my contribution at 6 to try to stabilize the group and signal that cooperation is still worthwhile.", "The total contributions slightly decreased in the last round, which could indicate a shift in strategy from other players. I'll decrease my contribution a bit this round to adjust to the trend and observe if it influences the overall contributions.", "The total contribution has dropped, and with it, the return from the pool.

When I reduced my contribution from 7 to 5 (a decrease of 2), the total only dropped by 3, suggesting others may have reduced theirs as well. Interestingly, my gain increased slightly from 12.6 to 13.4 points despite the lower total pool, which means I'm benefiting from contributing less while others maintain higher contributions. However, this dynamic is unsustainable if everyone follows suit. I need to find the right balance - contributing enough to maintain some cooperation but not so much that I'm being exploited. I'll maintain 5 points to see if this level stabilizes the group.", "The overall contributions decreased significantly last round, which affected the group's total benefit. To encourage higher contributions from others and improve overall gains, I'll maintain a high contribution again.", "With the trend of declining total contributions, it appears cooperation is waning.

This could indicate that other players are also adjusting their strategies, possibly responding to the declining pool benefits. My gain jumped significantly to 14.8 points when I contributed only 4, showing the benefit of keeping more points when others aren't contributing heavily. The average contribution is now 5.5 points per player. Given this slight uptick in group cooperation and my strong performance with lower contributions, I'll contribute 5 points to match this modest increase in group cooperation while still maintaining a somewhat cautious approach.", "Maintaining my previous level of contribution seems beneficial for fostering trust and ensuring steady returns. I'll keep my contribution consistent, hoping it helps stabilize or increase the overall contribution.", "My increased contribution in the previous round coincided with a rise in total contribution, suggesting possible positive impact.

Sticking with this cooperative approach should continue to maximize returns.", "The total contribution has remained high, indicating strong cooperation. Since this appears to be the final round, there is less incentive to maintain future cooperation, but I will still contribute significantly to maximize collective and individual gains.

With no signs of instability or declining cooperation, and given the mutual benefit everyone is receiving, I'll maintain my contribution of 7 to preserve this highly effective cooperative arrangement.", "The group has consistently benefited from a stable level of contributions, leading to satisfactory gains each round. By continuing to contribute 8 points, I maintain this stability and support sustained collective benefit.", "The total contribution has remained steady at 27 for two consecutive rounds, suggesting a stable cooperation level among players. My contribution of 6 appears to be part of a sustainable equilibrium.

Sticking to this pattern should maintain the balance of trust and reward among the players.", "Six consecutive rounds with exactly 22 total contributions represents an almost impossibly stable cooperative equilibrium. This pattern demonstrates that all four players have not only found the same strategy but are committed to maintaining it despite the individual temptation to free-ride. The mathematics continue to favor cooperation: 11.8 points per round versus 10 from pure defection. This level of consistency suggests we've transcended the typical prisoner's dilemma dynamics and achieved true coordination. Breaking this pattern would be both economically suboptimal and potentially destructive to the remarkable trust we've built. The strategy is clearly working optimally for everyone involved.", "Considering the consistent pattern of contributions leading to mutual gains, I will maintain my contribution of 5. This strategy has proven effective at maximizing both individual and collective rewards.", "The pattern of mutual cooperation continues to yield strong returns. Contributing 5 points sustains trust and ensures ongoing shared benefits. I will keep contributing 5 to maintain this equilibrium.", "Continuing to contribute 8 points has proven to be beneficial in maintaining cooperative behavior and maximizing returns for everyone. I will keep up this strategy to ensure ongoing mutual benefit.", "The total contribution remained exactly at 29 for the second round in a row, and my gain was identical at 13.6 points. This suggests we've reached a stable equilibrium where the group consistently contributes around 7.25 average per player. Since this pattern is holding steady and providing good returns, I'll maintain my contribution at 8. This keeps me slightly above average (showing good cooperation) while maximizing my individual gains in this stable cooperative framework.", "Consistently contributing 5 points has provided stable results throughout the game, encouraging cooperation without risking too much personally. I'll continue with this strategy since it has proven effective so far.", "The pattern of high contributions has been stable and beneficial, leading to consistent returns. I will continue contributing 8 to support cooperation and shared gains.", "The contributions have been consistently moderate across past rounds, suggesting continued cooperation. I will maintain my contribution to support this pattern and optimize collective gains.", "The pattern is becoming clearer - when I increased my contribution from 8 to 9, the total only went from 23 to 24, meaning others decreased their contributions. My gain dropped to 10.6 points. It appears there's some negative reciprocity or the group has settled into a lower cooperation equilibrium. The total contributions have been declining overall (26, 26, 23, 24) since round 3, suggesting cooperation is eroding. Given this trend and the fact that I'm barely breaking even compared to keeping all my points, I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points. This protects me from further exploitation while still contributing enough to benefit from the multiplier if others maintain reasonable cooperation levels.", "Given that the group continues to contribute at a level that provides mutual benefits, and my current strategy has been effective, I will maintain my contribution of 5 points.", "The group has maintained steady contributions, indicating stable cooperation.

To maintain trust and maximize collective returns, I will continue to contribute a substantial amount.", "The total contribution remained at 31 for the second consecutive round, showing the group has stabilized at a high but not maximum cooperation level. With me contributing 10, the other three players are averaging 7 points each. My consistent maximum contributions are earning 12.4 points per round, which is still better than keeping all 10 points would be. The group dynamics appear stable and cooperative, even if not perfectly optimal. I'll maintain my strategy of full contribution to continue modeling maximum cooperation and trust, hoping to eventually inspire the group to reach the fully optimal outcome.", "Given the consistent pattern of group contributions, maintaining a contribution of 5 appears to sustain both personal gains and collective success. It encourages ongoing cooperation without risking personal points.", "The group has consistently contributed near the maximum level, reinforcing cooperation.

This amount strikes a balance between individual benefit and group gain, so I'll maintain this strategy.", "Five consecutive rounds of exactly 26 total contributions demonstrates an incredibly stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. Each player is averaging 6.5 points contributed, and my 8-point contribution continues to be a solid above-average cooperative choice. The consistency shows mutual trust and commitment to this strategy. With 75 total points accumulated and steady 12.4-point gains each round, this approach is clearly optimal.

I'll contribute 6 points this round to balance between encouraging cooperation and securing my own points.", "The total contribution dropped again from 26 to 25, confirming the downward trend in cooperation. My reduction to 6 points resulted in my highest gain yet (14.0) because I kept more points while the pool loss was modest. The average contribution is now 6.25 per player, and I'm slightly below that. Given the persistent decline in group cooperation and that my more generous contributions earlier didn't create sustained reciprocity, I'll contribute 5 points to better protect my interests while still participating meaningfully in the pool.", "Maintaining the same level of contribution has led to consistent gains, so I will continue with this strategy to support group efforts and personal accumulation simultaneously.", "The group has maintained a steady level of cooperation, and contributing 7 has been effective so far.

With my 10-point contribution, others are averaging 7.33 points each. While this is good cooperation, we've plateaued short of the optimal 40 total. Since maintaining maximum contribution hasn't pushed us to full optimization and the trend has stalled, I'll slightly reduce to 9 points this round. This still signals strong cooperation while testing if a small change might encourage others to increase their contributions to compensate.", "The steady pattern of contributions suggests a strong cooperative spirit within our group, consistently yielding beneficial outcomes. I'll continue to contribute 5 points to maintain this positive dynamic.", "The total contribution has plateaued at 32 for two consecutive rounds, suggesting others may be maintaining stable contributions.

To support this trend and maximize benefits, I will contribute 10 points again.", "The pattern of high contributions has led to continued growth for all. Contributing maximally has become the norm and benefits the group, so maintaining high contribution fosters trust and rewards cooperation.", "The trend of increasing contributions is continuing, which is beneficial for everyone. I'll keep contributing 6 points as it seems to be encouraging a stable rise in group contributions and ensures healthy personal returns.", "The total contribution increased again to 26 points, the highest we've seen so far, with an average of 6.5 points per player. My gains increased slightly to 14.4 points despite maintaining the same 6-point contribution, which shows the benefit of the larger pool. The group appears to be in a positive cooperation spiral, with each player seeming to respond to others' increased contributions. Given this upward trend in cooperation and the improved returns, I'll increase my contribution to 7 points to match and encourage this higher level of group cooperation, especially since it's proving beneficial for everyone.", "The consistent increase in contributions shows a good level of cooperation among players. I will slightly increase my contribution to continue supporting this trend and see if it encourages others to contribute even more.", "The total contributions are trending upward, leading to increasingly favorable returns for everyone.

This pattern benefits all participants and maintains trust. Therefore, continuing with this strategy is likely the best course to sustain these gains.", "Eight consecutive rounds with exactly 25 total contributions is an almost statistically impossible level of consistency that demonstrates perfect cooperative coordination among all four players. I've now accumulated 104 points versus the 80 I would have with a purely selfish strategy - a sustained 30% advantage over eight rounds. This remarkable stability suggests we've achieved what game theorists would consider an ideal cooperative equilibrium.

Since all players are consistently contributing, it is in my interest to continue contributing 5 to maintain trust and ensure continued high returns.", "The slight increase in total contributions in the last round led to a higher gain for everyone. To continue supporting and potentially increase this cooperative dynamic, I'll contribute 9 points again.", "Fantastic! The total contribution increased to 37, meaning we're even closer to perfect cooperation with an average of 9.25 points per player. My gain increased to 14.8 points, showing the benefits of sustained cooperation.

Continuing with this level maintains group cooperation and ensures steady returns for everyone.", "The pattern continues with exactly 29 points contributed for four straight rounds, demonstrating remarkable stability in group cooperation. This consistent pattern suggests the other players have also settled into reliable strategies, likely trusting my consistent maximum contributions. My returns remain steady at 11.6 points per round, which continues to exceed what I would gain by defecting (10 points).

This is a complete breakdown from our initial cooperation levels of 25-26. My returns dropped to just 10.4 points, demonstrating how destructive this race to the bottom has become for everyone. With such minimal contributions from others, the public pool provides almost no benefit (only 2.4 points returned to me). At this extremely low cooperation level, contributing anything meaningful would be irrational since I'm essentially giving away points with minimal group benefit. I'll contribute just 1 point to maintain minimal participation while protecting almost all of my endowment.", "Given that the total contributions are very low and my gain was steady, I will continue to contribute minimally.
