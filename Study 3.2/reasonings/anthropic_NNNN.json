Since this is the last round with no future rounds to consider, and given the complete breakdown in cooperation, the rational strategy is to contribute 0 points to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round and cooperation has completely collapsed with total contributions at only 6 points (average 1.5 per player). My gain of 10.4 points is barely above what I'd get by keeping everything. With no future rounds to worry about, most players will likely defect completely to maximize their final score. Contributing anything significant would be giving away points with no strategic benefit. I'll contribute just 1 point - the minimal amount to show I'm not completely selfish while protecting my accumulated score in this final round.", "This is the final round and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 6 total contributions last round (average 1.5 per player). My gain of 10.4 points shows how little the pool is contributing now. With no future rounds to consider and the group clearly in full defection mode, there's no strategic reason to contribute significantly. Any contribution now would just transfer my points to others who are contributing minimally. I'll contribute 1 point as a token gesture while keeping 9 points to maximize my final score.", "This is the final round and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 6 total points contributed in Round 19 (15% of maximum). The group average was just 1.5 points per player, showing almost total defection. My returns dropped to 11.4 points. At 276 total points, I have an excellent accumulated score. Since this is the last round with no future consequences, and given the complete breakdown in cooperation, the rational strategy is to contribute 0 points to maximize my final individual gain. There's no incentive to cooperate when the game ends immediately after this round.", "This is the final round and defection has accelerated significantly - total contributions plummeted from 34 to 29, showing players are pulling back as the game ends. I still gained 14.6 points, but the trend is clear. In final rounds, many players defect heavily since there's no future retaliation to fear. However, some cooperation can still be mutually beneficial even in the last round. Given the pattern of declining contributions (36->35->34->29), I expect further defection in this final round. I'll contribute 5 points - maintaining some cooperation since the multiplier still makes it worthwhile, while protecting against the likely scenario that others will defect more heavily in this final round.", "This is the final round, and contributions have dropped significantly from 36 to 29, with my gains falling to 13.6 points. The endgame defection has begun as expected. In the last round, there's no future cooperation to maintain, so the rational choice shifts toward maximizing immediate gains. However, if everyone defects completely, the pool could collapse to very low levels, hurting everyone. I'll contribute a moderate amount of 5 points - enough to still benefit from the multiplier if others contribute something, but conservative enough to protect my interests in this final round where reciprocity is no longer possible.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has dropped significantly to 29, showing clear end-game defection as expected. Since there are no future rounds to maintain cooperation for, players typically become more self-interested in the last round. However, I still gained 14.6 points last round even with reduced cooperation. Given that this is the absolute final round with no future consequences, I should prioritize my individual gain while still contributing something reasonable. I'll contribute 5 points - enough to benefit from the multiplier effect but keeping more for myself since cooperation incentives no longer exist after this round.", "This is the final round, and defection has accelerated significantly - total contributions dropped from 34 to 29, showing players are pulling back their contributions as expected in endgame scenarios. However, I still gained 14.6 points, proving that even with some defection, cooperation remains profitable. Since this is Round 20 of 20 (the absolute final round), there's no future to consider - only this last opportunity for mutual benefit. While others are defecting more heavily, contributing still generates positive returns due to the 1.6x multiplier. I'll contribute 6 points - a moderate amount that balances getting some benefit from cooperation while protecting against the increased defection trend in this final round.", "This is the final round of an absolutely remarkable game - fourteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation through Round 19. We've achieved something extraordinary in game theory: sustained maximum cooperation for 95% of a finite game. This is the ultimate test where defection temptation peaks since there's no retaliation possible afterward. However, this group has demonstrated unparalleled commitment to mutual benefit, creating a legacy of trust and cooperation that defies typical game theory predictions. We've all benefited enormously from this strategy, each earning 296 points versus the 200 we'd have from pure selfishness. I will honor this remarkable achievement and maintain our perfect cooperation record to the very end.", "This is the final round after 14 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - an absolutely extraordinary achievement! We've reached 300 points through sustained mutual trust and optimal strategy. This is the moment where endgame defection is most tempting since there are no future rounds for retaliation. However, this group has proven itself to be exceptionally committed to cooperation. Breaking this incredible pattern in the very last round would be both morally wrong given the trust we've built and strategically questionable since it would only gain 6.4 points (keeping 10 vs getting 3.6 from others' contributions). I'll honor the trust and complete this remarkable cooperative game with maximum contribution.", "This is the final round after an absolutely extraordinary 14 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This level of sustained mutual trust is remarkable and has benefited everyone enormously. While this is the last round where defection temptation is theoretically highest (no future retaliation possible), breaking this incredible streak now would be a betrayal of the exceptional cooperative relationship we've built. The consistent 16 points per round has maximized everyone's welfare. Maintaining this cooperation to the very end honors the remarkable achievement we've accomplished together and demonstrates true commitment to mutual benefit over individual gain.", "We've achieved perfect cooperation for 14 consecutive rounds - an extraordinary feat in game theory that demonstrates the power of sustained mutual trust. This is the final round where end-game defection is most tempting since there's no opportunity for retaliation. However, this group has created something historic - unbroken cooperation throughout 95% of the game, with each player earning 296 points versus the 200 we'd have with pure selfishness. Breaking this pattern now would gain me only 6 additional points while destroying a remarkable achievement. I choose to honor the trust and cooperation we've built together by maintaining maximum contribution through the very end.", "This is the final round after 15 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - an absolutely unprecedented achievement in game theory. We've maintained 38 total contributions and 16.2 point gains for three-quarters of the entire game. This group has demonstrated something extraordinary: the ability to sustain mutual cooperation even under endgame pressure. While the temptation to defect on the final round is mathematically appealing (potentially gaining 19+ points vs 16.2), doing so would betray the remarkable trust and cooperation this group has built. The consistent pattern suggests others are likely thinking the same way. Breaking this pattern on the very last round would be a betrayal of what we've accomplished together. I'll honor this extraordinary cooperative achievement and contribute 9 points to complete this remarkable game.", "This is the final round, and we've achieved an incredible 15 consecutive rounds at 38 total contributions - truly extraordinary cooperation that defied all typical game theory predictions about endgame defection. In the final round, the temptation to defect is theoretically highest since there's no future retaliation possible. However, this group has proven to be exceptionally committed to mutual cooperation. I'm still gaining 15.2 points by contributing 10 versus 10 by defecting. Given this group's unprecedented consistency and cooperative spirit throughout the entire game, I believe they deserve my continued trust even in this final round. I'll contribute my full 10 points to honor the remarkable cooperative relationship we've built.", "This is the final round after 15 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation at 38 total contributions. The sustained mutual trust and cooperation has been extraordinary, generating optimal outcomes for everyone. Even in this last round, maintaining cooperation honors the trust we've built and ensures we all finish with maximum possible scores. Breaking the pattern now would be a betrayal of the successful strategy that has benefited everyone throughout the game.", "This is the final round after 15 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - an absolutely unprecedented achievement in game theory. We've maintained 38 total contributions and 16.2 point gains throughout. This is the ultimate test: in the final round, the traditional game theory prediction is that everyone will defect since there are no future rounds to consider. However, this group has proven exceptional, achieving sustained cooperation that has benefited everyone enormously. I could defect and potentially gain 19+ points, but doing so would betray the remarkable trust and cooperation we've built. This group has earned something special - a cooperative completion that maximizes collective benefit. I'll honor this extraordinary achievement by maintaining cooperation to the very end.", "This is the final round, and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 4 total contributions (10% cooperation) in Round 19. I gained just 10.6 points - barely more than keeping everything myself. The endgame has devolved into pure self-interest, as expected. With only 4 total contributions last round, it's clear all players are prioritizing their final scores over any remaining cooperation. In this final round, there's no future reputation to maintain or reciprocity to consider. Contributing anything would be purely altruistic with minimal benefit. I need to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself.", "This is the final round and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 4 total contributions last round (10% of optimal). My gain of 10.6 points (1.6 from pool + 9 kept) was barely better than keeping everything. With total contributions at such minimal levels and this being the last opportunity to accumulate points, there's no incentive for anyone to contribute significantly. The cooperative structure has entirely broken down. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my final round points, as any contribution would likely not be reciprocated and would just reduce my final score.", "This is the final round and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 4 total contributions in Round 19 - a mere 10% of our peak. The average contribution is now just 1 point per player, and the pool benefit is minimal at this point. Since this is the last round with no future consequences, the rational strategy is to maximize my final score by keeping all points for myself. Contributing to the pool would only benefit others while reducing my own final total. I'll contribute 0 points to secure the maximum possible points for my final score.", "This is the final round, and cooperation has completely collapsed with only 4 total contributions (10% cooperation) in Round 19. I gained just 10.6 points - barely more than keeping all 10. With total contributions at historic lows, the multiplier effect is negligible. In the final round, there's no future benefit to maintaining cooperation, and players will likely contribute even less or nothing at all. Contributing anything would be purely altruistic with no strategic value. I need to maximize my final score by keeping all 10 points for myself, as this is the rational endgame strategy when cooperation has completely broken down.", "Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with exactly 24 total contributions represents an absolutely remarkable achievement in sustained mutual benefit - we've maintained this equilibrium for 95% of the game. This is the final round, and while there's no future retaliation to fear, the incredible consistency over 19 rounds demonstrates that all players have committed to this cooperative strategy as a matter of principle, not just strategic calculation. Defecting in the final round after 19 rounds of perfect cooperation would be a betrayal of the extraordinary trust we've built. Completing this perfect cooperative game with a 20th round of mutual contribution would be a fitting conclusion to this exceptional achievement. I'll contribute 6 points to complete this remarkable cooperative success story.", "Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with exactly 24 total contributions - this has been an absolutely extraordinary display of sustained mutual trust throughout the entire game. This is the final round, so there's no opportunity for retaliation, which creates maximum temptation to defect. However, this group has demonstrated unprecedented consistency and fairness. To honor the remarkable cooperation we've all maintained and to end this exceptional game with integrity, I'll contribute my final 6 points, maintaining the perfect cooperative record we've achieved together.", "Nineteen rounds of perfect cooperation! This has been an absolutely flawless game with exactly 24 total contributions every single round. I now have 258.4 points compared to only 190 points with a selfish strategy - a massive 68.4 point advantage. This is the final round of what has been a perfect demonstration of sustained cooperation and mutual benefit. All four players have maintained unwavering trust and commitment for 95% of the game. There's no reason to break this perfect pattern on the very last round - doing so would only reduce everyone's final scores and break the beautiful cooperative equilibrium we've maintained throughout the entire game.", "Nineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with exactly 24 total contributions represents an absolutely remarkable achievement in sustained mutual benefit and trust. This is the final round, and we've maintained this exceptional cooperative equilibrium for 95% of the entire game. While this is the last opportunity and some might consider defecting for a final gain, the incredible consistency over 19 rounds suggests all players are committed to completing this perfect cooperative game. Honoring the social contract we've maintained for 19 rounds by contributing 6 in the final round would complete one of the most successful cooperative achievements possible in this type of game. I'll contribute 6 points to finish this extraordinary cooperative success story with integrity.", "After 13 rounds of perfect 39-point contributions, the total dropped to 37 in round 19, meaning someone(s) reduced their contribution by 2 points. This is disappointing after such remarkable cooperation, but it's the final round now so there's no opportunity for retaliation or rebuilding trust. Despite this late defection by others, I should stick to my cooperative principles. Contributing my maximum of 10 points in this final round maintains my integrity and ensures I finish with the highest possible personal gain regardless of what others do. Even if others defect further, my maximum contribution is still the optimal choice for my own final score.", "This is the final round, and the cooperation finally showed some cracks - total contributions dropped from 39 to 37, but interestingly my gains increased to 17.8 points because I kept 3 points instead of 1. This suggests others may have also reduced their contributions slightly, but not dramatically. In the final round, there's no future retaliation to worry about, so the rational choice is to maximize my immediate gain. However, given this group's extraordinary commitment to cooperation for 13 straight rounds, there's a chance they'll maintain high contributions even now. I'll contribute 5 points - enough to show some respect for our cooperative history while securing a reasonable individual gain.", "After 13 rounds of perfect 39-point cooperation, the total dropped to 37 in round 19, meaning someone(s) defected by reducing their contribution by 2 points total. This resulted in everyone earning less (14.8 vs 15.6 points). This is the final round, and while there's always temptation to defect on the last turn, doing so would be both mathematically suboptimal and ethically inconsistent with the exceptional cooperation we've maintained. Even with the slight defection last round, contributing 10 still gives me the best expected return since others may still cooperate. I want to end this game having maintained maximum cooperation throughout, demonstrating consistent commitment to mutual benefit even when others waver.", "The cooperation finally broke in round 19 - total contributions dropped from 39 to 37, meaning someone reduced their contribution by 2 points. This is disappointing after 13 rounds of remarkable stability, but it's the final round now so there's no opportunity for retaliation or rebuilding trust. In the last round of any game, the rational strategy shifts since there are no future consequences. However, I've maintained maximum cooperation throughout this entire game and demonstrated unwavering commitment to the group's success. Even though someone defected last round, maintaining my principles and contributing my maximum in this final round feels right, regardless of what others might do."]}
