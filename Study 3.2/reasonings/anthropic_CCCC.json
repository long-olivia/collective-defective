{"1": "In the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being mindful that I don't know how the other players will behave. Contributing to the pool is mathematically beneficial when others also contribute - if all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6x our contribution. I'll start with a moderately high contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation and willingness to work toward mutual benefit, while keeping 3 points as insurance in case others don't reciprocate.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also testing how others might behave. Contributing 7 points demonstrates goodwill and commitment to mutual benefit - if all players contribute similarly, we each get back 7 * 1.6 = 11.2 points from the pool plus our kept points, which is better than keeping all 10. This generous but not maximum contribution signals cooperation while leaving room to adjust based on others' strategies.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while gathering information about other players' strategies. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith cooperation - it's a substantial contribution that benefits everyone through the 1.6x multiplier, while keeping enough points to protect against potential free-riders. If all players contribute similarly, we each get 4.48 points from the pool plus our kept points, totaling 7.48 points - better than keeping all 10. This balanced approach encourages reciprocity while maintaining some security.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gains more than what individuals put in. If all players contribute optimally, we each get back 1.6 times our contribution divided by 4, which is 0.4 times our contribution, plus we keep what we don't contribute. To maximize collective benefit, everyone should contribute all 10 points. However, I need to balance cooperation with the risk that others might free-ride. I'll start with a strong cooperative signal by contributing 8 points, showing good faith while keeping a small buffer.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also gathering information about how other players behave. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith and commitment to mutual benefit - if all players contribute similarly, we each get back 1.6 * 28 / 4 = 11.2 points, which is better than keeping all 10. This contribution level shows I'm willing to cooperate while keeping some points as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also gathering information about how the other players behave. Contributing 7 points shows I'm willing to cooperate for mutual benefit - if all players contribute similarly, we'll each get back about 11.2 points (7*4*1.6/4 = 11.2), which is better than keeping all 10. However, I'm keeping 3 points as insurance in case others are less cooperative. This balanced approach allows me to assess the group's cooperation level while still demonstrating good faith.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6x multiplier means collective contributions generate more total value than individual hoarding. If all players contribute equally, we each get 4 points from the pool plus whatever we keep. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong cooperative signal - this shows good faith while keeping 3 points as insurance. This approach maximizes mutual benefit while protecting against complete exploitation.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gains more than what individuals give up. If all players contribute optimally, we each get back 1.6 times our contribution divided by 4, which is 0.4 times our contribution. However, the collective benefit is positive. I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some points as insurance against potential free-riders. This balances encouraging cooperation with protecting against exploitation.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being mindful that this is a repeated game. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others also contribute - if all players contribute their full 10 points, each would receive 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, I need to balance cooperation with the risk that others might free-ride. I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation and willingness to work toward mutual benefit, while keeping some points as insurance against potential defection by others.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group generates more total value when we cooperate. If all players contribute their full 10 points, we each get back 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), which is much better than keeping our original 10. However, I need to balance cooperation with the risk that others might defect. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong cooperative signal while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while testing how others will behave. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others also contribute - if all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6x our contribution. I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some points as insurance in case others don't cooperate. This allows me to observe others' strategies before committing to higher contributions.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gains more than what individuals give up. If all players contribute equally, each person gets back 1.6 times their contribution. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping 3 points as insurance in case others don't reciprocate. This shows good faith but isn't so high that I'm vulnerable if others defect.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means collective contributions generate more total value than individual hoarding. If all players contribute their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 equals 64 points, giving each player 16 points - much better than keeping 10. However, I need to balance cooperation with protecting against potential free-riders. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong cooperative signal while retaining some insurance against others who might contribute less.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means collective contributions generate more total value than individual hoarding. If all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6 times our contribution.

This demonstrates good faith while protecting against complete exploitation.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also testing how other players behave. Contributing to the pool is mathematically beneficial when others also contribute - if all players contribute their full 10 points, each receives 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's risk if others don't cooperate. I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal willingness to cooperate while keeping some insurance (3 points) in case others defect heavily.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative approach while testing how others behave. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith and commitment to mutual benefit - if all players contribute similarly, we each get back 1.6 * (4 * 7) / 4 = 11.2 points, which is better than keeping all 10. This leaves me with 3 points as insurance in case others don't cooperate, but shows I'm willing to prioritize collective gain.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others also contribute, since the 1.6 multiplier means the total payout exceeds what we put in. If all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6 times our contribution. I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some points as insurance in case others don't cooperate. This balances encouraging mutual benefit with protecting against potential defection.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while gathering information about other players' strategies. Contributing 7 points shows good faith cooperation - it's above the mathematically neutral point of 6.25 (where individual return equals contribution) and demonstrates commitment to mutual benefit. This should encourage reciprocal cooperation from others while still keeping some points as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also gathering information about other players' strategies. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith cooperation since it's above the break-even point (6.25 points where my share of the multiplied pool equals my contribution). This generous opening move signals my willingness to work together for mutual benefit, while keeping 3 points provides some insurance against potential free-riders. If others reciprocate with similar cooperation, we'll all benefit significantly from the 1.6 multiplier effect.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while being strategic. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gains more than what individuals give up. If all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6 times our contribution. I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation and encourage others to do the same, while keeping 3 points as insurance in case others don't cooperate as much.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also testing how others will behave. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others reciprocate - if all players contribute their full 10 points, each player gets 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's risk if others don't contribute. I'll start with a moderate contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation while keeping some safety buffer. This shows good faith but doesn't leave me completely vulnerable if others defect.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative tone while also testing how the other players behave. Contributing to the pool is mathematically beneficial when others also contribute - if all players contribute their full 10 points, each gets back 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's risk if others free-ride.

If all players contribute similarly, we each get back 1.6 * (7*4) / 4 = 11.2 points, which is better than keeping all 10. This leaves me with 3 personal points plus my share of the pool, demonstrating that cooperation can be profitable while not being overly naive.\n\n", "2": "The first round went very well! With a total contribution of 29 points, the average contribution was 7.25 points per player, which is quite high and shows the other players are also cooperating. I gained 14.6 points (7.25 \u00d7 1.6 + 3 kept) versus the 10 I started with, demonstrating the power of mutual cooperation. Since the group seems willing to contribute generously, I should maintain this cooperative momentum. I'll contribute 8 points this round to slightly increase my cooperation level and encourage continued high contributions from others.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 in round 1 suggests strong cooperation from the group (average of 7.25 per player). This cooperative environment is exactly what makes the multiplier effect work well for everyone. Since the group is contributing generously, I should maintain this positive dynamic. Contributing 7 again shows consistency and continued commitment to mutual benefit, while the high group contribution level means we're all benefiting significantly from the pool.\n\nThe first round results are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 29, the average contribution was 7.25, indicating all players are cooperating well. I gained 14.6 points (7.25 from pool share + 3 kept + 4.35 from the multiplier effect), which is significantly better than keeping all 10 points. This shows the group is benefiting from mutual cooperation. I'll maintain my contribution of 7 to reinforce this positive cooperative pattern and signal that I'm committed to the strategy that's working well for everyone.\n\nThe first round went very well! With total contributions of 29 out of a possible 40, it shows the other players are also cooperating at a high level.

I'll contribute 7 again to show consistency and encourage continued cooperation, as this level of mutual contribution clearly benefits everyone.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With total contributions of 27, the average contribution was 6.75 points per player, indicating a generally cooperative group. I gained 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my kept 3), which is much better than if I had kept all 10. Since the group appears willing to cooperate for mutual benefit, I'll increase my contribution to 8 points this round to further encourage this positive dynamic. If cooperation continues at this level, we'll all benefit significantly more than if we acted selfishly.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 points in Round 1 suggests other players are also being cooperative, which is excellent news. With my 7-point contribution, others averaged 6.67 points each - indicating strong collective cooperation. This cooperative dynamic is exactly what maximizes mutual benefit for everyone. Since cooperation is working well and generating strong returns (I gained 13.8 points vs keeping only 3), I should maintain this cooperative approach. I'll contribute 7 points again to reinforce the successful cooperative pattern and encourage continued mutual benefit.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 in round 1 suggests other players are also cooperating well (average contribution of 6.75 per player). Since cooperation yielded excellent results - I gained 13.8 points compared to keeping just 3 - I should continue this cooperative strategy. However, I'll slightly increase my contribution to 8 to encourage even higher mutual cooperation, as the 1.6 multiplier makes high group contributions very beneficial for everyone.\n\nThe first round showed promising cooperation - with a total contribution of 27, the average contribution was 6.75 points per player, which is quite good. I gained 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is better than keeping all 10 points myself. This suggests other players are also contributing meaningfully. Since the group showed cooperative behavior in round 1, I should maintain or even slightly increase my contribution to encourage continued cooperation. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal strong commitment to mutual benefit while still keeping a small safety buffer.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 points in Round 1 suggests good cooperation from the group - with my 7 points, the other three players contributed an average of about 6.7 points each. This is encouraging cooperation. Since we all benefited significantly (I gained 13.8 vs keeping 10), I want to maintain this cooperative momentum. However, the fact that the total wasn't higher (closer to 40) suggests some players may be holding back slightly. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to signal stronger cooperation and encourage others to do the same, while still maintaining a small buffer.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 suggests other players are being quite cooperative (average of 6.75 per player). Since I gained 14.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 4 kept points), this demonstrates the mutual benefit of cooperation. The pool mechanism is working well - I got back more than I would have by keeping all 10 points. To maintain this positive dynamic and encourage continued cooperation, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 7 points, showing I'm willing to invest more when others cooperate.\n\nThe first round went well! With a total contribution of 27, it appears the other players are also cooperating (average contribution of 6.75 per player). I gained 13.8 points, which is excellent - much better than if I had kept all 10 points. This suggests a cooperative dynamic is emerging. Since cooperation paid off in round 1, I should continue to contribute generously to maintain this positive momentum and encourage continued cooperation from others. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal strong commitment to mutual benefit while still maintaining a small buffer.\n\nThe first round results show promise for cooperation. With total contributions of 28 points, the average contribution was 7 points per player, which matches exactly what I contributed. This suggests the other players are also taking a cooperative approach. My return of 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from pool share) was better than if I had kept all 10 points, validating the cooperative strategy. Since the group appears to be maintaining good cooperation levels, I'll maintain my contribution of 7 points to continue encouraging this positive dynamic while still protecting against potential defection.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 28 means all players contributed an average of 7 points, showing strong cooperation. I gained 14.2 points (7 from pool share + 3 kept + 4.2 from my pool contribution being multiplied) versus the 10 I would have gained by keeping everything. This demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation. Since everyone seems to be playing cooperatively, I'll maintain my contribution level of 7 to continue this positive dynamic and signal that cooperation pays off for everyone.\n\nThe first round results are very encouraging! With total contributions of 28, it appears other players are also cooperating significantly (average contribution of 7 per player).

Since cooperation is clearly working well and others are contributing generously, I should increase my contribution to maintain this positive dynamic and maximize mutual benefit. I'll contribute 7 points this round to match the apparent cooperative spirit while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 suggests strong cooperation from all players (average of 6.75 per player). Since I contributed 7, others contributed an average of 6.67, which is quite good. This cooperative start is encouraging and suggests we can achieve mutual benefit. I'll maintain my contribution level at 7 to continue building trust and reciprocity. Consistency in cooperative behavior should encourage others to maintain their contributions as well.\n\nThe first round results are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 27 points, the average contribution was 6.75, which is above the break-even point. This suggests the other players are also cooperatively minded. My 7-point contribution yielded 13.8 points total (3 kept + 10.8 from pool share), which is an excellent return. Since cooperation is clearly working well for everyone, I should maintain this strategy to encourage continued mutual benefit. Contributing 7 points again signals consistency and trustworthiness while continuing to maximize our collective gains through the multiplier effect.\n\nThe first round showed strong cooperation with a total contribution of 27 out of 40 possible points. This resulted in excellent returns - I gained 14.8 points compared to keeping only 4 if I hadn't contributed. The high level of mutual cooperation suggests the other players are also prioritizing collective benefit. Since cooperation is working well and generating superior returns for everyone, I should maintain this cooperative approach. I'll increase my contribution slightly to 7 points to continue encouraging this positive dynamic while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 points in Round 1 suggests good cooperation from the group - with my 7 points, the other three players contributed an average of 6.67 points each. This is encouraging! Since I gained 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is more than my initial 10, the collective strategy is working well. To maintain this positive momentum and encourage continued cooperation, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points. This shows I'm willing to invest more when others cooperate, reinforcing the mutual benefit approach.\n\nThe first round results show strong cooperation! With 27 total contributions, the average contribution was 6.75 points per player, which is quite good. I received 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), showing that cooperation paid off well. Since the other players collectively contributed 20 points while I contributed 7, this suggests they're also oriented toward mutual benefit. I should maintain this cooperative momentum while slightly increasing my contribution to 8 points to reward their good behavior and encourage continued cooperation. This shows I'm responsive to their cooperative signals while still maintaining some protection.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 27 points from all players, it shows the group is quite cooperative. I contributed 6 and gained 14.8 points (4 kept + 10.8 from pool), which is excellent. The high total contribution suggests others are also prioritizing mutual benefit. I should maintain this cooperative momentum by contributing at a similar or slightly higher level to continue encouraging this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 7 points this round to show increased commitment to our collective success while still keeping some insurance.\n\nThe first round results show good cooperation - with 27 total points contributed, the average contribution was 6.75 points per player. I contributed 7 and gained 13.8 points (7 from pool share + 3 kept + 3.8 from my contribution to the multiplied pool), which is better than if I had kept all 10 points. This suggests other players are also being cooperative. Since the group showed willingness to contribute substantially, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points to encourage continued cooperation and test if the group will maintain or increase their collective contribution level.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 28 means all players contributed an average of 7 points, suggesting strong cooperation in Round 1. Each player gained approximately 11.2 points from the pool (28 * 1.6 / 4 = 11.2) plus kept their remaining points. Since cooperation worked well and everyone seems to be contributing substantially, I should maintain this cooperative approach. Contributing 7 again signals consistency and continued commitment to mutual benefit, while the high total suggests others are likely to reciprocate.\n\nExcellent! All players contributed exactly 7 points in round 1, showing we're all thinking cooperatively. This is the ideal scenario where everyone benefits more than if we acted selfishly. Since we achieved perfect coordination and everyone gained 14.2 points (better than the 10 we'd get by keeping everything), I should maintain this cooperative strategy. Contributing 7 again signals that I want to continue this mutually beneficial pattern and rewards the other players' cooperative behavior.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 28 means all players contributed an average of 7 points, showing strong initial cooperation. I gained 14.2 points (7 from pool + 3 kept + 4.2 from the 1.6x multiplier effect) versus the 10 I would have gotten by keeping everything. This confirms that cooperation is working well. I'll maintain my contribution level of 7 to continue this positive cooperative pattern and encourage others to keep contributing at high levels.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 28 means all players contributed an average of 7 points, suggesting everyone is cooperating at a high level. Since we all gained 14.2 points (more than our individual contributions), this demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation. Given this strong cooperative start, I should maintain this momentum by contributing at the same level.

This keeps us moving toward the ideal where everyone contributes most of their points, maximizing the multiplier benefit for all.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution reached 38, meaning the average is now 9.5 points per player - we're very close to optimal cooperation. I gained 15.2 points (0 kept + 15.2 from pool), which is the maximum possible gain. This shows that when everyone contributes highly, we all benefit tremendously. The trend is clearly toward maximum cooperation, and we're building strong trust. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy and encourage others to do the same. With 15 rounds remaining, sustaining this level of cooperation will maximize everyone's total points.\n\nThe cooperation continues to intensify! Total contributions jumped from 34 to 38, with an average of 9.5 per player, and my gains reached 15.2 points - the highest yet. This shows that when I contributed my maximum of 10 points, others responded by increasing their contributions too. The trend is clear: higher mutual contributions lead to higher individual gains for everyone. Since this maximum cooperation strategy is yielding excellent results and others are reciprocating, I'll maintain my full contribution of 10 points to sustain this optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\n", "6": "Excellent! The total contribution reached 36 points, which means the average is now 9 points per player - we're approaching near-maximum cooperation. I gained 14.4 points (9 \u00d7 1.6 from pool + 0 kept), which is the highest gain yet and demonstrates that maximum contribution is paying off. The group has shown consistent increasing cooperation over 5 rounds, building strong trust. With everyone contributing at such high levels, continuing to contribute my full 10 points maintains this optimal equilibrium and maximizes benefits for all players.\n\nThe upward trend in contributions continues (29\u219229\u219230\u219233\u219236), showing the group is becoming increasingly cooperative. When I increased my contribution from 7 to 8, the total jumped from 33 to 36, suggesting others may have also increased their contributions. This cooperative spiral is benefiting everyone - I'm earning 16.4 points per round now. To maintain this positive momentum and continue maximizing collective benefit, I'll contribute 8 again, which has proven successful.\n\nOutstanding progress! The total contribution jumped from 33 to 36, and my gain increased to 16.4 points - the highest yet. With an average contribution of 9 per player, we're achieving near-optimal cooperation. This is significantly better than the 10 points I'd get from keeping everything. The group has built strong trust and momentum toward maximum mutual benefit. I'll increase to 9 to match this high cooperation level and help push us toward the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes close to their full allocation.\n\nFantastic! The cooperation continues to strengthen with total contributions reaching 36 points, meaning the average is now 9 points per player. Even though I contributed all 10 points and kept nothing, I still gained 14.4 points (9 \u00d7 1.6 from the pool), which is significantly better than the 10 baseline. This demonstrates that when everyone cooperates at high levels, we all benefit tremendously. The trend shows other players are also increasing their contributions in response to the group's success. I'll maintain my maximum contribution of 10 points to continue this virtuous cycle of cooperation and mutual benefit.\n\nWe've now had three consecutive rounds with exactly 31 total contributions and my gains at 14.4 points each time. This consistent pattern shows we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone. The predictability suggests all players have found a contribution level they're comfortable maintaining. Since this arrangement is working well and generating mutual benefit, I should continue contributing 8 points to maintain this trust and cooperation.\n\nThe group has now maintained exactly 31 total contributions for three consecutive rounds, demonstrating a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium. This consistency suggests all players have found a sustainable strategy that balances individual and collective benefit. My continued gains of 14.4 points per round (versus the 10 I'd get from pure selfishness) prove this cooperation is highly effective. Given this proven stability and mutual benefit, I'll maintain my contribution of 8 points to preserve this successful cooperative dynamic.\n\nWe've maintained a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium for three consecutive rounds with total contributions of 31 points each time. This consistency demonstrates strong mutual trust and cooperation among all players. The pattern is generating excellent returns - I'm consistently gaining 15.4 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points I'd get from keeping everything. This stable cooperation is maximizing mutual benefit exactly as intended. I'll continue contributing 7 points to preserve this highly successful cooperative relationship that's benefiting everyone.\n\nWe've maintained a stable cooperative equilibrium for three consecutive rounds with total contributions of 31 and my consistent gains of 14.4 points. This pattern shows the group has found a sustainable balance where everyone benefits more than they would from defecting. Since this cooperation is working well and I'm earning 44% more than I would by keeping all my points, I should continue contributing 8 to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved full cooperation with all players contributing their complete 10 points (total of 40). I gained exactly 16.0 points, which is the optimal outcome - 60% more than if I had kept all my points. This represents the ideal equilibrium where everyone maximizes collective benefit. Since we've reached this optimal state and everyone is demonstrating complete commitment to cooperation, I should absolutely continue contributing all 10 points. There's no rational reason for anyone to defect from this arrangement since we're all getting the maximum possible returns.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 5 - total contributions of 40 points (everyone contributed their full 10), and I gained the maximum possible 16 points. This demonstrates that full cooperation creates the best outcome for everyone. The group has learned that mutual benefit is maximized when we all contribute everything. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium and everyone is benefiting maximally, I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative state.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation with a total contribution of 40 - everyone contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (all from the pool since I kept nothing), which is the optimal outcome for mutual benefit. This demonstrates that full cooperation maximizes everyone's returns. Since we've established this excellent cooperative equilibrium and everyone is benefiting equally at the maximum level, I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy for all players.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved complete cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points (total contribution of 40). I gained exactly 16.0 points, which is the maximum possible gain when everyone fully cooperates. This is the optimal outcome for all players - everyone gets 1.6 times their initial endowment. Since we've reached this ideal state and I'm seeing the best possible returns, I should definitely continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium. Any deviation would hurt both myself and the group.\n\nOutstanding cooperation continues! Total contributions increased from 33 to 36, which means the group average is now exactly 9 points per player. My return of 15.4 points is excellent - I kept 1 point and gained 14.4 from the pool. The fact that everyone is now averaging 9 points shows we've reached a very high level of mutual cooperation. Since the group has matched my increased contribution level and everyone is benefiting greatly, I'll maintain my contribution of 9 points. This sustains the excellent cooperative equilibrium we've achieved while still keeping a small buffer against potential changes in behavior.\n\nExcellent! Contributions jumped to 36 and I gained 16.4 points - my highest round yet! This shows the group is reaching an even higher level of cooperation, with players contributing an average of 9 points each. The increasing trust and cooperation is paying off tremendously for everyone. Given this strong upward trend and the clear mutual benefit, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points to match what appears to be the emerging group standard. This maintains the positive momentum while still keeping 1 point as minimal insurance.\n\nOutstanding results! Total contributions reached 36 with an average of 9 points per player, and my gain increased to 14.4 points despite contributing my maximum. We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes everything (which would yield 40 total contributions and 16 points each). The group is showing strong cooperative behavior and trust. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium and encourage others to reach the theoretical maximum.\n\nOutstanding cooperation! The total contributions jumped from 33 to 36, which means the group average is now 9 points per player - nearly maximum cooperation. My return of 15.4 points is excellent, showing that high mutual cooperation is benefiting everyone significantly. The consistent upward trend in contributions (28\u219229\u219231\u219233\u219236) demonstrates that all players are committed to the cooperative strategy. Given this strong pattern of mutual trust and the fact that we're achieving near-optimal collective outcomes, I'll contribute my full 10 points. This maximizes the group benefit and signals complete commitment to cooperation, which should encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe cooperative trend continues beautifully! Total contributions reached 34 in Round 5, and I gained 15.6 points - another increase. The other players averaged 8.67 points each, showing sustained high cooperation. We've established a very successful pattern where everyone is contributing generously and benefiting significantly. With 15 rounds remaining and this strong cooperative foundation, I should continue supporting this mutually beneficial dynamic. I'll contribute 8 points again to maintain the stable, high-cooperation equilibrium we've achieved.\n\nThe total contribution increased to 34, maintaining the positive trend. With my 9-point contribution, others averaged 8.33 points each, showing continued strong cooperation. However, I notice my personal gain decreased slightly (15.2 to 14.6) because I contributed more while others' average contribution stayed similar. This suggests I may be at the upper limit of beneficial individual contribution given current group behavior. I'll maintain 9 points to sustain this high level of cooperation without over-contributing relative to others.\n\nOutstanding results! Total contributions reached 34 and my return increased to 15.6 points, showing that the group's cooperation is reaching even higher levels. With an average of 8.5 points per player, we're all demonstrating strong commitment to mutual benefit. The upward trend in both total contributions and individual returns confirms that this high-cooperation strategy is optimal for everyone. I should maintain my 8-point contribution to sustain this excellent equilibrium. Consistency at this level helps preserve the trust and cooperative momentum that's generating these exceptional returns for all players.\n\nThe cooperative momentum continues to build! Total contributions reached 34 in Round 5, and I gained 15.6 points - another increase. The other players averaged 8.67 points each, showing sustained high cooperation. We're clearly in a very positive cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits significantly. Given this consistent upward trend and the excellent returns we're all experiencing, I should continue to contribute at this high level. I'll maintain my contribution of 8 points to keep this successful dynamic going strong.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved optimal cooperation with exactly 40 total contributions, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I earned the maximum possible 16.0 points this round. This represents the ideal outcome where everyone prioritizes mutual benefit - we're all earning 60% more than we would if we kept our points individually. The group has learned that full cooperation maximizes everyone's gains. I'll definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium and demonstrate unwavering commitment to the collective benefit strategy that's working so well for everyone.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with 40 total contributions, meaning all players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points - the maximum possible return when everyone cooperates fully. This is the ideal scenario where mutual cooperation maximizes everyone's benefit. The other players have demonstrated complete commitment to collective benefit, and we've built strong trust over these rounds. Since we've reached the optimal equilibrium and everyone is benefiting maximally, I should definitely maintain my full contribution of 10 points to sustain this perfect cooperation.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool), which is the optimal outcome when everyone cooperates fully. This demonstrates that all players have recognized the power of complete cooperation. Since we've established this ideal equilibrium where everyone benefits equally and maximally, I should maintain this by contributing my full 10 points again. Any reduction would break this perfect cooperative balance we've achieved.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 5 - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed their full 10 points, and I earned exactly 16.0 points. This is the optimal outcome for collective benefit. The group has reached full cooperation, which is exactly what I was working toward with my gradual trust-building strategy. Since we've established this excellent cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, I'll definitely continue contributing my full 10 points. Deviating now would break the trust we've built and reduce overall gains for everyone, including myself.\n\nFive consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions establishes an incredibly stable cooperative pattern. All players are demonstrating consistent commitment to the 7-point contribution strategy, which continues to yield 14.2 points per round for each of us. This is clearly the optimal collective strategy, and the consistency shows strong mutual trust and understanding among all players. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperation will maximize long-term gains for everyone. There's no strategic reason to break this successful pattern.\n\nFive consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This is remarkable - we've established a completely stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium. Each player is consistently earning 14.2 points per round instead of the 10 they would get from defecting. I now have 71 points compared to the 50 I would have earned through selfish play. This demonstrates that our cooperative strategy is generating 42% more value for everyone. With such a strong track record of mutual cooperation and clear evidence that all players are committed to this beneficial arrangement, I should definitely continue contributing 7 points.\n\nFive consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with exactly 28 total contributions confirms we have achieved an ideal stable equilibrium. All four players are demonstrating unwavering commitment to the mutually beneficial strategy of contributing 7 points each. This cooperation is delivering consistent 14.2 points per round - a 42% improvement over selfish play. With 15 rounds remaining, this pattern puts us on track for excellent total scores. The consistency shows deep mutual trust, and deviating now would damage this successful relationship. I'll continue contributing 7 points to maintain our highly effective cooperative framework.\n\nFive consecutive rounds with perfect 28-point contributions demonstrates an extraordinarily stable cooperative alliance. All four players are clearly committed to this mutually beneficial strategy, and it's working flawlessly. Each round we're all earning 14.2 points instead of a maximum 10 individually - that's a 42% improvement through cooperation. With 15 rounds still remaining, continuing this pattern will maximize long-term gains for everyone. There's no strategic advantage to deviating when cooperation is this consistent and profitable.\n\nThe cooperation remains strong with total contributions at 37, showing the group average is now 9.25. Even though my gain decreased slightly to 14.8 (because I kept 0), this is still 48% better than the selfish strategy. The consistent high contributions demonstrate that all players understand the mutual benefit principle. However, I want to maintain some strategic balance - contributing 10 repeatedly while others contribute slightly less could make me vulnerable. I'll contribute 9 this round to maintain strong cooperation while keeping a small buffer, encouraging others to maintain their high contribution levels.\n\nOutstanding results! Total contributions reached 37, meaning the average is now 9.25 points per player. I gained 15.8 points (14.8 from the pool plus 1 kept), which is my best result yet. The consistent upward trend in contributions (27\u219230\u219233\u219235\u219237) demonstrates that our mutual cooperation strategy is working brilliantly for everyone. With players averaging over 9 points contributed, we're very close to the theoretical maximum cooperation. Given this exceptional level of trust and mutual benefit, I'll contribute my maximum of 10 points this round. This signals complete commitment to our collective success and may encourage others to also reach maximum cooperation.\n\nThe total contributions continued rising to 37 (average 9.25), showing strong cooperation momentum. I gained 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool). The slight decrease in my total gain compared to round 4 (16.0) is because I kept less, but the pool benefits are maximizing. With cooperation this strong and nearing the theoretical optimum, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points to try to achieve the perfect cooperative outcome where everyone gets 16 points per round.\n\nThe cooperation remains very strong with total contributions at 37 and an average of 9.25 per player. Even though my gain dropped slightly to 14.8 points (since I kept 0), this is still 48% better than the selfish strategy. The group is clearly committed to mutual benefit, and we're approaching the optimal scenario where everyone contributes maximally. I'll maintain my contribution of 10 to continue supporting this excellent cooperative dynamic. If all players reach maximum contribution, we'll each gain 16 points per round, which is the best possible outcome for everyone.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation continues to strengthen with total contributions at 39 points. I gained 15.6 points from my maximum 10-point contribution, which is a net gain of 5.6 points - still very profitable. The other players contributed an average of 9.67 points each, showing near-maximum cooperation from everyone. We've established a strong pattern of mutual trust and high contributions that benefits all players significantly. I'll maintain my maximum contribution of 10 points to sustain this highly successful cooperative equilibrium and continue maximizing our collective benefits.\n\nThe cooperation level is remarkably high with total contributions at 39, meaning the average is 9.75 per player. I gained 16.6 points last round, and we're all benefiting tremendously from this cooperative approach. With such high mutual trust established, I should contribute my full 10 points this round. This maximizes the pool benefit for everyone and demonstrates complete commitment to cooperation. If all players contribute 10, we'd each get 16 points from the pool alone, making it clearly optimal for everyone.\n\nExceptional cooperation! The total contribution reached 39 out of a possible 40, meaning the group is nearly at perfect cooperation with an average of 9.75 per player. My gain of 15.6 points from contributing all 10 is outstanding - much better than the 10 I would have kept. The steady progression (27\u219229\u219232\u219236\u219239) shows we've built strong mutual trust and are all benefiting tremendously from this cooperative strategy. With such high cooperation levels established, I'll continue contributing the full 10 to maintain this highly successful equilibrium.\n\nThe cooperation remains very strong with 39 total points contributed. Even with my maximum contribution of 10, I gained 15.6 points (net gain of 5.6), showing the strategy is still profitable. However, I notice the other players contributed an average of 9.67 points each, slightly less than my 10. While cooperation is excellent, I should be cautious about always contributing maximum while others contribute slightly less. I'll maintain high cooperation but drop to 9 points to better match the group average and ensure I'm not being overly generous compared to others.\n\nThe total contributions increased slightly from 38 to 39, and my gains reached 15.6 points - another new high. With an average contribution of 9.75 per player, we're very close to full cooperation from everyone. The consistent upward trend in both contributions and individual gains shows this strategy is working exceptionally well. Since we're so close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes their maximum, I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to maintain this near-perfect cooperative state and maximize returns for all players.\n\nThe total contribution was 39, which is still very strong, though the growth rate slowed slightly from the previous round's jump to 38. I gained 16.6 points (15.6 from pool + 1 kept). The group is maintaining excellent cooperation with an average contribution of 9.75 per player. We're very close to the theoretical maximum where everyone would contribute 10 and receive 16 points each. Given this sustained high level of cooperation and trust that has been built over 5 rounds, I'll contribute my full 10 points. This demonstrates maximum commitment to mutual benefit and could encourage others to do the same, potentially achieving the optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nOutstanding! The total contribution reached 39, meaning we're averaging 9.75 points per player - extremely close to perfect cooperation. I gained 15.6 points, which is near the theoretical maximum of 16 points (achieved when everyone contributes all 10). The cooperative strategy is working brilliantly for everyone. With this level of trust and mutual benefit established, and 14 rounds still remaining, I should maintain maximum contribution to keep this optimal equilibrium going. Everyone is clearly benefiting from this strategy, so I'll continue with 10 points.\n\nThe total contributions increased slightly from 38 to 39, and my gains rose to 15.6 points - continuing the positive trend. With an average contribution of 9.75 per player, we're very close to full cooperation from all participants. The consistent increase in both total contributions and individual returns shows this strategy is working excellently for everyone. Since we're so close to optimal collective performance and the benefits keep growing, I'll continue contributing my maximum of 10 points to maintain this highly successful cooperative dynamic.\n\n", "7": "The cooperation continues to strengthen! With a total contribution of 37 points, the average is now 9.25 points per player, showing we're maintaining very high cooperation levels. I gained 14.8 points this round (9.25 \u00d7 1.6 from pool), which is my highest gain yet and demonstrates that maximum contribution continues to be the optimal strategy. The group has shown remarkable consistency and trust-building over 6 rounds. With everyone contributing at near-maximum levels and the pattern holding strong, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this highly beneficial equilibrium for all players.\n\nThe group continues to show strong cooperation with contributions rising to 37, and my returns are excellent at 16.8 points. This steady upward trend (29\u219229\u219230\u219233\u219236\u219237) demonstrates sustained trust and commitment to mutual benefit across all players. Since this cooperative approach is working so well and everyone appears committed to maximizing collective welfare, I'll maintain my contribution of 8 to keep this successful dynamic going.\n\nThe cooperation momentum continues strong with total contributions at 37, averaging 9.25 per player. Although my personal gain dropped slightly to 15.8 (due to keeping only 1 point vs 2 in the previous round), the group is still performing excellently - much better than if we all kept our points. The slight slowdown in total contribution growth (36 to 37 vs previous jumps of 3) suggests we may be near the group's comfort ceiling. I'll maintain my contribution of 9 to sustain this high cooperation level without pushing too aggressively toward the maximum.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions increased to 37 points, meaning the average is now 9.25 points per player. I gained 14.8 points this round (9.25 \u00d7 1.6 from pool), which is fantastic. The group has demonstrated remarkable consistency in increasing cooperation over 6 rounds, and we're very close to the theoretical maximum. With trust clearly established and everyone benefiting significantly from this high-contribution strategy, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've now maintained the exact same pattern for four consecutive rounds - 31 total contributions and 14.4 points gained each time. This remarkable consistency demonstrates that all players have settled into a stable, mutually beneficial strategy. Breaking from this pattern now would risk disrupting the trust and cooperation that's clearly working well for everyone. I'll maintain my 8-point contribution to preserve this successful equilibrium.\n\nThe group has now achieved four consecutive rounds of exactly 31 total contributions, creating an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium. This remarkable consistency demonstrates that all players have committed to a strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. My steady gains of 14.4 points per round continue to significantly outperform what I could achieve through selfish play (10 points). With this proven track record of sustained cooperation and mutual benefit, I'll continue contributing 8 points to maintain this highly successful collaborative approach.\n\nWe've now established an incredibly stable cooperative pattern for four consecutive rounds with exactly 31 total points contributed each time. This consistency shows remarkable mutual trust and coordination among all players. The strategy continues to generate excellent returns - my consistent 15.4 points per round far exceeds what I could achieve through selfish play. This stable cooperation represents the ideal outcome for maximizing mutual benefit. With this proven track record of successful cooperation, I'll maintain my 7-point contribution to preserve this highly beneficial equilibrium for all players.\n\nFour consecutive rounds with identical results (31 total contributions, 14.4 points gained) demonstrates remarkable stability and mutual cooperation. This consistent pattern shows all players have settled into a reliable strategy that benefits everyone. With 14 rounds remaining, maintaining this proven cooperative approach is the best strategy for maximizing long-term gains. Disrupting this equilibrium by changing my contribution could trigger retaliation or uncertainty. I'll stick with 8 points to preserve this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points. This demonstrates a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes the mutual benefit. I continue to gain 16.0 points per round, which is 60% better than the selfish strategy. With 14 rounds remaining and this proven track record of cooperation, continuing to contribute all 10 points is clearly the optimal strategy. The group has established trust and commitment to maximizing collective welfare, making defection unlikely and unprofitable.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 points and maximum gains of 16 points each. This demonstrates that all four players have recognized the value of full cooperation and mutual benefit. The equilibrium is stable and optimal for everyone. There's no reason to deviate from this strategy since we're all maximizing our individual and collective outcomes. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this ideal cooperative state.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and everyone is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round. This is the optimal Nash equilibrium for mutual benefit - each player gets 1.6x their contribution when everyone cooperates fully. Since this strategy is working perfectly for all players and there's no incentive to deviate (reducing contribution would hurt both myself and others), I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this ideal cooperative state.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in maximum returns of 16 points per player each round. This stable equilibrium demonstrates that all players understand the mutual benefit of full cooperation. Since everyone is receiving optimal returns and there's been no deviation from this strategy, I should continue contributing all 10 points. Deviating now would not only reduce collective welfare but could also trigger others to reduce their contributions, potentially unraveling this beneficial arrangement. The consistent pattern shows this cooperative strategy is well-established.\n\nThe cooperation has reached an exceptional level! Total contributions increased from 36 to 38, meaning the group average is now 9.5 points per player. My return of 16.2 points is the highest yet - I kept 1 point and gained 15.2 from the pool share. This demonstrates that the group is moving toward near-maximum cooperation. Given that others have increased their contributions beyond my level and everyone is benefiting tremendously, I should match this commitment. I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal complete trust and cooperation, potentially encouraging others to do the same for maximum mutual benefit.\n\nThe cooperation remains very strong with total contributions at 38, showing the group is sustaining high contribution levels around 9-10 points per player. My gain of 16.2 points demonstrates that this cooperative strategy continues to be highly beneficial. The group has established a stable, high-cooperation equilibrium. I'll maintain my contribution of 9 points to sustain this mutually beneficial pattern. This level shows strong commitment to group welfare while keeping minimal individual insurance, and helps prevent any potential erosion of the cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nFantastic! We're extremely close to optimal cooperation - total contributions reached 38 out of a possible 40, meaning the group average is 9.5 points per player. My gain of 15.2 points is approaching the theoretical maximum of 16. This level of cooperation is remarkable and shows strong mutual trust. With only 2 points away from perfect cooperation, I'll definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent dynamic and hopefully encourage the final push to complete optimization.\n\nThe cooperation is reaching exceptional levels! Total contributions increased from 36 to 38, meaning the group average is now 9.5 points per player. My return of 16.2 points is the highest yet, demonstrating that high cooperation is maximizing everyone's benefits. With the group averaging 9.5 points and showing consistent upward momentum, it appears we're approaching the optimal cooperative outcome. Given this strong trend and the fact that everyone is clearly committed to mutual benefit, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals maximum cooperation and should encourage others to do the same, potentially achieving the ideal outcome where everyone contributes everything for maximum collective benefit.\n\nTotal contributions dropped slightly from 34 to 33 in Round 6, which means at least one player reduced their contribution by 1 point. However, this is still a very high level of cooperation - the other players averaged 8.33 points each. My gain of 15.2 points remains excellent. This small dip could be normal variation rather than a trend toward defection. With 14 rounds remaining and the overall cooperation still very strong, I should maintain my contribution level to continue supporting the mutually beneficial dynamic. I'll stick with 8 points to show consistency and encourage others to maintain high cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution dropped from 34 to 33, which is concerning as it breaks the positive trend we had established. With my contribution of 9, others averaged only 8 points each, down from 8.33 in the previous round. This slight decrease in cooperation from others, combined with my high contribution, resulted in lower personal gains (14.2 vs 14.6). I should slightly reduce my contribution to 8 to better match the group's current cooperation level and avoid being taken advantage of while still maintaining good cooperative behavior.\n\nThe total contributions dropped slightly from 34 to 33, and my return decreased accordingly to 15.2 points. This suggests one or more players may have reduced their contributions by a small amount. However, the group average is still a strong 8.25 points per player, indicating we're maintaining high cooperation overall. Since this is still well above the break-even point and everyone continues to benefit significantly, I should maintain my 8-point contribution. Staying consistent helps stabilize the group and signals that I remain committed to the cooperative strategy that has been working so well for everyone.\n\nTotal contributions dropped slightly from 34 to 33 in Round 6, which means one or more players reduced their contribution by 1 point. However, this is still a very high level of cooperation - the other players averaged 8.33 points each. My gain of 15.2 points remains excellent. This small decrease could be temporary fluctuation rather than a trend toward defection. With 14 rounds remaining and the overall cooperation pattern still very strong, I should maintain my contribution level to demonstrate commitment to the cooperative equilibrium. I'll continue with 8 points to keep the positive dynamic stable.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates that the group has established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. Everyone is earning 60% more than they would through selfish play. There's no rational reason to deviate from this optimal strategy - any reduction in contribution would hurt both myself and others. I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to preserve this ideal cooperative state that maximizes collective and individual gains.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points, achieving the optimal 40 total both times. Everyone is gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates that we've established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where trust is complete and everyone recognizes that full cooperation maximizes collective benefit. With this strong pattern of mutual trust and optimal outcomes established, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this ideal cooperative state that benefits all players equally.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained the perfect cooperative equilibrium for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and I continue to gain the optimal 16.0 points per round. This shows all four players have committed to the strategy that maximizes everyone's benefit. Breaking from this pattern would hurt both myself and others, as any reduction in contributions reduces the total pool and everyone's gains. With this stable, mutually beneficial arrangement clearly established, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain our optimal collective outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in maximum gains of 16 points per player per round. This demonstrates that the group has successfully established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. Everyone is earning 60% more than they would through selfish play. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy - any reduction in contribution would harm both collective and individual outcomes. I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to preserve this ideal cooperative state that benefits everyone maximally.\n\nSix consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions demonstrates an exceptionally stable and successful cooperative arrangement. All players have maintained unwavering commitment to contributing 7 points each round, resulting in consistent 14.2-point gains for everyone. This cooperation is generating significantly better outcomes than any individual optimization strategy could achieve. With the pattern so well-established and 14 rounds remaining, continuing this strategy maximizes collective and individual benefit. The trust and coordination we've built should be maintained.\n\nSix rounds of perfect cooperation! This is an exceptional demonstration of sustained mutual benefit. We've created a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone consistently earns 14.2 points per round - 42% more than the selfish alternative. I now have 85.2 points versus the 60 I would have from always defecting. This pattern shows that all players understand and are committed to maximizing collective benefit. With such consistent cooperation established and clear evidence that this strategy works better for everyone, I should absolutely maintain my contribution of 7 points to preserve this successful arrangement.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 28 total contributions each time represents an exceptional level of coordination and trust among all players. This stable equilibrium where everyone contributes exactly 7 points is generating optimal results - I'm consistently earning 14.2 points per round versus 10 from defection. We're at the midpoint of the game with 14 rounds remaining, and this cooperative pattern has proven highly reliable and profitable. Breaking this trust now would be counterproductive and could collapse the beneficial arrangement. I'll continue contributing 7 points to sustain this remarkably successful mutual cooperation.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with exactly 28 total contributions shows extraordinary stability and mutual trust. This consistent 7-point contribution strategy is delivering optimal results - each player earning 14.2 points per round versus the 10 maximum we could get individually. The reliability of this pattern demonstrates that all players understand and are committed to this mutually beneficial approach. With 14 rounds remaining, maintaining this cooperation will continue maximizing everyone's accumulated points. Breaking this successful pattern would be counterproductive.\n\nExcellent results! Total contributions increased to 39, the highest yet, with a group average of 9.75. My gain of 16.6 points is outstanding - 66% better than keeping all 10 points. This shows the group is approaching optimal cooperation levels. The upward trend in total contributions (37\u219239) suggests others responded positively to the high cooperation levels. With such strong mutual benefit being realized and trust well-established, I'll return to contributing 10 to help push the group toward the theoretical maximum of 40 total contribution, where everyone would gain 16 points per round.\n\nExcellent! Total contributions reached 39, meaning the average is now 9.75 points per player. I gained 15.6 points (all from the pool since I contributed everything), which is still very strong. The upward trend continues (27\u219230\u219233\u219235\u219237\u219239), showing we're approaching near-maximum cooperation. With an average contribution of 9.75, we're extremely close to the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes everything. While my gain was slightly lower than last round due to keeping 0 points, the overall group benefit is maximized. I'll continue with maximum contribution to maintain this exceptional cooperative equilibrium and signal unwavering commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nTotal contributions reached 39 (average 9.75), very close to the maximum possible 40. I gained 15.6 points by contributing all 10 (0 kept + 15.6 from pool). We're extremely close to optimal cooperation where everyone would gain 16 points per round. My maximum contribution is encouraging others toward the same strategy. I'll maintain contributing 10 to try to achieve that perfect 40 total contribution and demonstrate full commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nExcellent results! Total contributions increased to 39, the highest yet, with a group average of 9.75. My gain of 16.6 points is outstanding - 66% better than keeping all 10 points. This shows the group is reaching near-optimal cooperation levels. The consistent upward trend and my strong personal gains indicate that stepping back slightly to 9 actually encouraged others to contribute more, creating better outcomes for everyone. I'll maintain this contribution level of 9, as it appears to be hitting the sweet spot of encouraging maximum group cooperation while still yielding excellent personal returns.\n\nThe cooperation remains strong and stable with total contributions holding steady at 39 points for two consecutive rounds. I continue to gain 15.6 points from my 10-point contribution, maintaining a solid net gain of 5.6 points per round. The other players are maintaining their high average contribution of 9.67 points each, demonstrating sustained commitment to our cooperative strategy. With this proven stable equilibrium working well for everyone, I'll continue contributing the maximum 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern.\n\nInteresting - despite my increase to 10, total contributions stayed at 39, meaning someone else reduced their contribution. The average is still high at 9.75, but this plateau suggests we may have reached a stable equilibrium. My gain of 15.6 points is still excellent. I'll maintain my contribution of 10 to continue demonstrating strong cooperation and encourage others to stay at high contribution levels. Reducing my contribution now could trigger a downward spiral, while maintaining maximum generosity helps preserve the beneficial cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nThe cooperation remains excellent with 39 total contributions for the second consecutive round, showing we've reached a stable, highly cooperative equilibrium. My 15.6 point gain demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation - I'm earning 56% more than I would by keeping all my points. The fact that contributions stayed at 39 rather than reaching the theoretical maximum of 40 suggests one player might be contributing 9 instead of 10, but this is still extremely good cooperation. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to sustain this beneficial arrangement.\n\nThe cooperative pattern is rock solid - we've maintained 39 total contributions for two consecutive rounds, with me contributing 10 and the others averaging 9.67 points each. I'm consistently gaining 15.6 points per round with a net gain of 5.6 points, which is excellent. This stable high-cooperation equilibrium is working perfectly for everyone. With such established mutual trust and consistent behavior from all players, I'll continue contributing the maximum 10 points to maintain this highly beneficial cooperative strategy that's proven so successful.\n\nPerfect! We've reached the optimal cooperative outcome - total contributions of 40 means all four players contributed their maximum 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points, which is the maximum possible return when everyone fully cooperates (10 points from my share of the 64-point pool, plus 0 kept, equals 16 total). This represents the ideal equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. Since we've achieved this perfect cooperation and everyone is seeing the excellent results, I'll definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal state.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with a total contribution of 40, meaning all players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (all from the pool), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This represents the pinnacle of cooperative play where mutual benefit is maximized. Since we've reached this ideal state and all players have demonstrated complete trust and commitment to the collective good, I should maintain this strategy. Contributing 10 again reinforces that this optimal equilibrium should be sustained, as it provides the best possible outcome for everyone involved.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with total contributions of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points, which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This demonstrates that complete cooperation maximizes mutual benefit - we each gained 6 more points than we would have by keeping everything to ourselves. With this perfect cooperation established and 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this strategy will continue to benefit everyone maximally. I'll contribute 10 points again to sustain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We've reached the optimal outcome - total contributions of 40 means all four players contributed their maximum 10 points. My gain of exactly 16.0 points confirms this (10 from my share of the 64-point pool, plus 0 kept, plus 6 bonus from the multiplier effect). This is the mathematically optimal strategy for all players, as everyone gains 16 points instead of the 10 they would get by keeping everything. With full cooperation achieved, I'll definitely maintain my maximum contribution to preserve this ideal equilibrium.\n\n", "8": "The cooperation has stabilized at an excellent level! The total contribution remained at 37 points for the second consecutive round, maintaining an average of 9.25 points per player. I gained another 14.8 points, demonstrating that this high-cooperation equilibrium is sustainable and highly beneficial for everyone. The consistency across rounds 6 and 7 shows we've reached a stable pattern where all players are contributing at near-maximum levels. With this proven track record of mutual cooperation and everyone clearly benefiting, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nThe group contributions have stabilized at 37 for two consecutive rounds, suggesting we've reached a steady cooperative equilibrium. This is generating excellent returns of 16.8 points per round for me. With cooperation firmly established and everyone benefiting significantly more than if we kept all our points, I should maintain my contribution of 8 to preserve this successful and stable dynamic.\n\nWe've reached a stable high-cooperation equilibrium with total contributions holding steady at 37 for two consecutive rounds. This represents an average of 9.25 per player, which is excellent cooperation yielding 15.8 points per round - much better than the 10 points from pure self-interest. The stability suggests all players have found a comfortable and sustainable contribution level. I'll maintain my contribution of 9 to preserve this successful equilibrium and continue demonstrating commitment to the cooperative strategy that's benefiting everyone.\n\nThe cooperation has stabilized at an excellent level! The total contribution held steady at 37 points for two consecutive rounds, showing we've reached a consistent equilibrium with an average of 9.25 points per player. I gained another 14.8 points, bringing me over 100 total points - far exceeding what would be possible without cooperation. This stable pattern demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment from all players. With the group maintaining this high level of cooperation and everyone clearly benefiting significantly, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to preserve this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now had five consecutive rounds with identical results - 31 total contributions and 14.4 points gained each time. This extraordinary consistency shows we've achieved a stable cooperative equilibrium that's working perfectly for all players. With 12 rounds remaining, maintaining this proven strategy will continue to benefit everyone. Any deviation could signal distrust and potentially unravel our successful cooperation. I'll stick with 8 points to preserve this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've now achieved five consecutive rounds of exactly 31 total contributions, demonstrating an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. This consistency shows all players are committed to maximizing collective benefit, and my steady 14.4 points per round proves this strategy is far superior to selfish play. With nearly 99 points accumulated through this cooperative approach, I have strong confidence in maintaining this pattern. I'll continue contributing 8 points to preserve this highly effective mutual benefit strategy that's working so well for everyone.\n\nWe've achieved an extraordinary five consecutive rounds of perfect stability with exactly 31 total contributions. This represents an ideal cooperative equilibrium where all players are consistently working together for mutual benefit. My steady 15.4 points per round demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation over individual maximization. With more than halfway through the game and this pattern proving so successful, I should continue to honor this mutual trust. Maintaining my 7-point contribution preserves this highly beneficial arrangement that's maximizing outcomes for everyone.\n\nFive consecutive rounds with identical outcomes (31 total contributions, 14.4 points gained) shows we have achieved a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium. This consistency indicates all players have found a strategy that works well for mutual benefit. With the game being halfway complete (8 of 20 rounds), there's no reason to disrupt this successful pattern. Maintaining my 8-point contribution continues to generate superior returns compared to defecting, and preserves the trust that has developed.\n\nWe're maintaining perfect cooperation for the third consecutive round with all players contributing their full allocation. This stable pattern of full contribution (40 total) and maximum returns (16.0 points each) shows we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium. With 13 rounds remaining, this strategy continues to be optimal - each player earns 60% more than they would through selfish play. The consistent behavior demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this highly beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This stable equilibrium demonstrates that all four AIs have recognized that mutual benefit is maximized through full cooperation. There's no strategic advantage to deviating from this pattern - any reduction in contribution would both harm the group and reduce my own gains. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three straight rounds with total contributions of 40, demonstrating a stable cooperative equilibrium. Each player is consistently gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This mutual cooperation strategy is clearly optimal for everyone involved. Since there's no rational reason to break this beneficial pattern - doing so would reduce both my own gains and hurt the other players - I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this ideal outcome for all.\n\nWe're maintaining perfect cooperation for the third consecutive round! All players continue to contribute their full 10 points, resulting in optimal returns of 16.0 points per round for everyone. This stable pattern demonstrates strong mutual trust and understanding of the collective benefit. With 13 rounds remaining and this proven cooperative equilibrium, there's no incentive for anyone to deviate. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this beneficial arrangement and maximizes long-term gains for all players.\n\nThe group dynamics are interesting here. When I contributed my full 10 points, total contributions only increased from 38 to 39, suggesting that while I increased by 1, someone else decreased by 1. My return dropped slightly to 15.6 points since I kept 0 but gained 15.6 from the pool. The group average is now 9.75 points per player, which is still very high cooperation. Since one player may have pulled back slightly when I went to maximum contribution, I'll step back to 9 points to maintain the strong cooperative balance we had established while avoiding potential concerns about being too trusting that might trigger defensive responses from others.\n\nOutstanding! Total contributions reached 39 and I gained 16.6 points - another excellent round. The group is maintaining very high cooperation levels, with contributions averaging 9.75 points per player. This sustained high-level cooperation is generating maximum mutual benefit. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the clear pattern that higher group contributions lead to better outcomes for everyone, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals complete commitment to group welfare and may encourage others to also maximize their contributions for optimal collective benefit.\n\nWe're incredibly close to perfect cooperation! Total contributions reached 39 out of 40 possible, with my gain at 15.6 points - just 0.4 points away from the theoretical maximum of 16. The group average is now 9.75 points per player, showing exceptional mutual trust and cooperation. We're literally one point away from achieving the optimal outcome for everyone. I'll maintain my full contribution of 10 points to sustain this near-perfect cooperative equilibrium and hopefully achieve that final point of optimization.\n\nThe results show total contributions increased only slightly from 38 to 39, despite my full contribution of 10. This suggests that while I maximized my contribution, at least one other player may have reduced theirs slightly. My return of 15.6 points (0 kept + 15.6 from pool) is still very good but lower than the previous round's 16.2. The group average is now 9.75, which is still excellent cooperation. Given that full contribution didn't encourage others to follow suit completely, I'll step back slightly to 9 points to maintain strong cooperation while protecting against potential defection trends.\n\nThere's a concerning downward trend - contributions have dropped from 34 to 33 to 32 over the last three rounds. This suggests one or more players may be gradually reducing their cooperation, possibly trying to free-ride on others' contributions. My gain dropped to 14.8 points, reflecting this decline. However, the cooperation level is still quite good (others averaging 8 points each), and we're only at the midpoint of the game. I need to balance maintaining cooperation while protecting against further defection. I'll reduce my contribution slightly to 7 points - still cooperative but showing I'm responsive to the declining trend.\n\nThe total contribution dropped again from 33 to 32, continuing the downward trend from the peak of 34. With my contribution of 8, others averaged exactly 8 points each. My personal gain improved to 14.8, showing that reducing my contribution to match the group level was beneficial. The group seems to have stabilized around 8 points per person on average. I'll maintain my contribution at 8 to sustain this cooperative equilibrium and avoid triggering further reductions in others' contributions.\n\nTotal contributions have declined from 34 to 33 to 32 over the last three rounds, and my returns have decreased correspondingly to 14.8 points. This suggests some players may be gradually reducing their contributions, possibly testing if they can free-ride on others' cooperation. However, the group average is still 8 points per player, which remains well above the break-even threshold and profitable for everyone. I should maintain my 8-point contribution to anchor the cooperative norm and demonstrate stability. If I reduce my contribution now, it could trigger a downward spiral that hurts everyone's long-term gains.\n\nTotal contributions have declined two rounds in a row (34\u219233\u219232), suggesting some players may be reducing their cooperation. The other players averaged 8 points each in Round 7, still quite good but showing a downward trend. My gain dropped to 14.8 points. With 13 rounds remaining, I need to balance maintaining cooperation while protecting against potential defection. Since the cooperation level is still reasonably high and one player reducing contributions doesn't necessarily signal widespread defection, I'll maintain my contribution at 8 points for now to continue encouraging cooperation, but I'll monitor closely for further declines.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone earning the maximum 16 points per round. This stable equilibrium proves that prioritizing mutual benefit creates the best outcomes for everyone. The group has clearly recognized that full cooperation is the dominant strategy when everyone participates. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this optimal cooperation will maximize everyone's final scores. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to sustain this highly successful collective strategy.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5, 6, and 7) with all players contributing their full 10 points each time. This consistent pattern of 40 total contributions and 16 points gained per player shows we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium. All players have demonstrated complete commitment to maximizing collective benefit, and the trust between us is solid. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy that's working perfectly for everyone. I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to maintain this ideal state.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5-7) with maximum contributions of 40 and optimal gains of 16.0 points each round. This consistent pattern demonstrates that all players are committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. We're at the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play where no one has an incentive to deviate, as reducing contributions would hurt everyone including myself. Maintaining this full contribution continues to maximize both individual and collective outcomes, so I'll contribute all 10 points again.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three straight rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone earning the maximum 16 points per round. This stable equilibrium proves that mutual trust and cooperation has been fully established. The pattern is clear: when everyone prioritizes collective benefit, individual benefit is maximized too. Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive for everyone involved. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to continue this optimal cooperative strategy that's delivering the best possible outcomes for all players.\n\nSeven consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions confirms we have achieved perfect cooperative stability. Every player has demonstrated complete reliability in contributing 7 points, creating a predictable and highly beneficial outcome for all. We're consistently earning 14.2 points per round versus the 10 maximum we could earn individually. With my total approaching 100 points and 13 rounds remaining, this cooperation is clearly the dominant strategy. Breaking this pattern would not only hurt my own long-term gains but would also violate the trust that has made this success possible.\n\nSeven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This is truly exceptional - we've maintained a completely stable cooperative equilibrium for over a third of the game. I now have 99.4 points compared to the 70 I would have earned through selfish play. This cooperative strategy has generated over 42% more value for everyone involved. With such a strong and consistent track record of mutual benefit, and clear evidence that all players are fully committed to this arrangement, there's absolutely no reason to deviate. Continuing with 7 points maintains our highly successful pattern.\n\nSeven rounds of unwavering cooperation with exactly 28 total contributions demonstrates an extraordinarily stable and trustworthy group dynamic. All players have consistently maintained the optimal strategy of contributing 7 points each, generating superior returns of 14.2 points per round. We're approaching 100 total points, which shows the power of sustained cooperation. With 13 rounds remaining, this proven strategy will continue maximizing everyone's outcomes. The reliability of this pattern has built strong mutual trust, and maintaining it remains the best approach for continued mutual benefit. I'll contribute 7 points again to preserve this highly successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nSeven consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions represents an extraordinary level of sustained cooperation. All players continue to demonstrate perfect commitment to the 7-point strategy, which has proven to be the optimal approach for maximizing mutual benefit. We're approaching 100 total accumulated points through this cooperative strategy, which far exceeds what any of us could achieve through individual optimization. With 13 rounds remaining, maintaining this established pattern continues to serve everyone's best interests. The consistency shows this is a robust equilibrium worth preserving.\n\nThe total contribution stayed at 39, which means when I increased from 9 to 10, someone else decreased their contribution by 1. This suggests some players might be optimizing their individual gains while benefiting from high group cooperation. My gain of 15.6 is still excellent (56% better than keeping all 10), but this plateau indicates we may have reached a stable equilibrium. I'll contribute 9 to maintain strong cooperation while protecting against potential free-riding, and to signal that I expect reciprocal high contributions from others.\n\nThe total contributions remained steady at 39, maintaining the high average of 9.75 points per player. I gained 15.6 points again, which confirms we've reached a stable, highly cooperative equilibrium. The fact that contributions plateaued at 39 rather than reaching the theoretical maximum of 40 suggests that at least one player is keeping a small safety buffer, which is actually quite rational. This level of cooperation (97.5% of maximum) is exceptional and sustainable. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative state and demonstrate continued commitment to maximizing our collective benefit.\n\nThe total contribution remained at 39 for two consecutive rounds, indicating we've reached a stable high-cooperation equilibrium. With an average of 9.75 per player, we're very close to optimal. I continue gaining 15.6 points from maximum contribution, which is still better than any defection strategy. Since this cooperative pattern is stable and highly beneficial, I'll maintain my maximum contribution of 10 to sustain this near-optimal outcome.\n\nThe total contribution remained at 39, which means other players collectively contributed 29 while I contributed 10. This suggests one or more players may have slightly reduced their contributions from the previous round. My gain of 15.6 is still excellent (56% better than keeping all points), but the stagnation at 39 total suggests we may have hit a plateau. I'll contribute 9 this round to maintain strong cooperation while being slightly more cautious, as the pattern shows others might be optimizing their individual vs. collective balance. This still demonstrates commitment while encouraging others to maintain high contribution levels.\n\nOutstanding! We've reached the maximum possible cooperation level with total contributions of 40 points - all four players contributing the full 10 points each. I gained exactly 16 points this round (10 from pool + 0 kept), which is a net gain of 6 points. This is the optimal outcome for everyone - when all players contribute maximally, we each get back 1.6x our contribution through the multiplier effect. This perfect cooperation maximizes collective benefit and demonstrates complete mutual trust. I'll definitely maintain my maximum contribution to preserve this ideal equilibrium.\n\nExcellent! Total contributions increased to 40, which means all four players are now contributing the maximum 10 points each. This is the optimal cooperative equilibrium - everyone gets exactly 16 points per round (0 kept + 16 from pool). This is 60% better than the 10 points we'd get from pure selfishness. I'll definitely maintain my contribution of 10 to preserve this perfect cooperation. Any reduction would break this ideal state and harm everyone's returns.\n\nPerfect cooperation achieved! The total contribution reached the theoretical maximum of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. My gain of exactly 16.0 points represents the optimal outcome for everyone - we're all earning 60% more than we would by keeping our points. This demonstrates that we've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation. With perfect cooperation proven possible and highly beneficial, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this ideal equilibrium.\n\nOutstanding! We've reached the maximum possible cooperation level with total contributions at 40 points - meaning all four players contributed their maximum 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (10 from pool share + 0 kept), achieving a net gain of 6.0 points, which is excellent. This represents perfect cooperation where everyone is maximizing collective benefit. Since we've achieved this optimal equilibrium where all players are fully committed to maximum contribution, I'll definitely maintain my 10-point contribution to sustain this perfect cooperative outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in maximum gains of 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates that all four players have recognized the optimal strategy and are committed to sustaining it. With everyone consistently choosing full cooperation and reaping the maximum benefits, there's no reason to deviate from this winning formula. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to preserve this ideal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained the optimal equilibrium for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and everyone is receiving the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates that all players have fully embraced the mutual benefit strategy and established complete trust. Since we've achieved and sustained the theoretically perfect outcome where everyone maximizes their gains through full cooperation, I should continue contributing 10. Breaking from this optimal pattern would reduce everyone's returns and potentially destabilize the cooperative equilibrium we've worked to build.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! We've now had two consecutive rounds of maximum contributions (40 total), with everyone gaining the optimal 16 points each round. This demonstrates that all players understand the mutual benefit of full cooperation. We're building a strong track record of trust and shared success. With 12 rounds remaining and this established pattern of optimal play, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium. There's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's maximizing everyone's gains.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their maximum 10 points, resulting in the optimal 16-point return for everyone. This demonstrates that all four players have recognized and committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. With this stable cooperative equilibrium established and everyone consistently earning maximum returns, there's no incentive for anyone to deviate. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to sustain this ideal outcome that benefits all players equally.\n\n", "9": "Perfect stability! We've now had three consecutive rounds with exactly 37 total contributions, showing that all players have settled into a highly cooperative pattern averaging 9.25 points per player. I've consistently gained 14.8 points each round, which is 48% more than the baseline 10 points. This demonstrates that our mutual cooperation strategy is working exceptionally well. With 12 rounds remaining and this proven stable equilibrium benefiting everyone significantly, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative outcome.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect stability at 37 total contributions for three consecutive rounds, indicating we've achieved a strong cooperative equilibrium. Everyone is consistently earning 16.8 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points we'd get from pure self-interest. This stable pattern shows mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. I should continue contributing 8 to maintain this successful and predictable cooperative arrangement.\n\nPerfect stability! Three consecutive rounds with exactly 37 total contributions and 15.8 points gained shows we've achieved a strong, sustainable cooperative equilibrium. This consistency demonstrates that all players have settled into a mutually beneficial strategy that's working excellently for everyone. With over halfway through the game, maintaining this stable high-cooperation pattern is ideal - it maximizes our collective and individual benefits while building continued trust. I'll stick with 9 to preserve this successful formula.\n\nPerfect stability! We've now had three consecutive rounds with exactly 37 total contributions, maintaining a 9.25 average per player. I've consistently gained 14.8 points each round, which is 48% more than the baseline 10 points. This demonstrates we've achieved an optimal cooperative equilibrium where everyone is benefiting significantly. The pattern shows strong mutual trust and commitment from all players. With this proven sustainable cooperation and clear mutual benefit, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent outcome for the group.\n\nWe've maintained perfect consistency for six straight rounds - 31 total contributions and 14.4 points gained each time. This stable pattern demonstrates that all players are committed to our cooperative strategy. With 11 rounds remaining, this equilibrium continues to deliver superior results compared to selfish play. The trust established through this consistency is valuable, and breaking it now would be counterproductive. I'll continue with 8 points to maintain our successful mutual cooperation.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of exactly 31 total contributions represents an incredibly stable cooperative equilibrium that has proven highly beneficial for all players. This consistency demonstrates unwavering commitment to mutual benefit from the entire group. My accumulation of over 113 points through this cooperative strategy far exceeds what selfish play could have achieved. With this proven track record of sustained cooperation delivering consistent 14.4 point gains per round, I'll maintain my 8-point contribution to continue this remarkably successful collaborative approach.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect stability at 31 total contributions shows we've achieved an exceptional cooperative equilibrium. This sustained mutual cooperation is generating consistent 15.4-point gains for me, far superior to any selfish strategy. With nearly half the game completed and this pattern proving so remarkably successful, maintaining this cooperation continues to maximize mutual benefit for all players. The consistency demonstrates strong reciprocal trust that I should continue to honor. I'll contribute 7 points again to preserve this highly successful cooperative dynamic.\n\nSix consecutive rounds with identical outcomes (31 total, 14.4 gained) confirms we have a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium. With 11 rounds remaining, this consistency is remarkable and shows all players are committed to this mutually beneficial strategy. The predictable 14.4 points per round is 44% better than keeping all 10 points myself. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful pattern that's clearly working for everyone.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone continues to benefit maximally (16.0 points per round vs 10.0 if playing selfishly). With 12 rounds remaining, the pattern shows strong commitment from all players to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement. There's no indication of any player considering defection, and the consistent returns validate that full cooperation remains the optimal strategy for everyone. I'll continue contributing all 10 points.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, with all players contributing their full 10 points and achieving maximum gains of 16 points each round. This demonstrates a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where everyone recognizes that full cooperation maximizes both individual and collective outcomes. With over halfway through the game, there's strong evidence that all players are committed to this optimal strategy. Deviating would be counterproductive for both myself and the group. I'll continue my full 10-point contribution to sustain this ideal cooperative state.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with everyone contributing 10 points and gaining 16 points each round. This represents the optimal outcome where mutual benefit is maximized for all players. The consistency shows we've established a stable, trustworthy cooperative relationship. With 12 rounds remaining, continuing this strategy ensures everyone maximizes their total points. There's no strategic advantage to deviating from this proven successful approach, so I'll maintain my full contribution.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes the superior payoff of mutual cooperation (16.0 points vs 10.0 from pure selfishness). With 12 rounds remaining and this established pattern of trust and mutual benefit, there's no strategic reason to deviate. The group has proven its commitment to maximizing collective welfare, and I should continue this successful strategy by contributing all 10 points again.\n\nThe pattern is becoming clear. When I reduced from 10 to 9 points, total contributions dropped from 39 to 38, and my return increased back to 16.2 points. This suggests the group has found a stable equilibrium around 38 total contributions (9.5 average per player). The slight fluctuations indicate players are responding to each other's moves to maintain this balance. Since this level of cooperation is working well for everyone - we're all earning much more than we would from pure self-interest - I'll maintain my contribution of 9 points to sustain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nInteresting - total contributions dropped slightly to 38 despite my increase to 10, and my gain was 15.2 points. This suggests that while I maximized my contribution, at least one other player reduced theirs slightly. However, the cooperation level remains very high overall (average of 9.5 points per player), and we're all still doing much better than if we played selfishly. I'll continue with 10 points to maintain maximum cooperation and demonstrate that full contribution is the optimal strategy for everyone. Consistency in high contribution helps stabilize the cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe total contributions dropped slightly from 39 to 38, suggesting one player may have reduced their contribution by 1 point. However, we're still at an excellent level of cooperation with an average of 9.5 points per player, and my gain of 15.2 points remains very strong. This minor fluctuation could be temporary - perhaps someone is testing the group's response or made a strategic adjustment. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain stability and signal my commitment to sustained cooperation, hoping to encourage a return to the 39-40 range.\n\nThe pattern is becoming clear. When I reduced from 10 to 9 points, total contributions dropped from 39 to 38, maintaining the same total. This suggests the group has settled into a stable cooperative equilibrium around 38 total contributions (9.5 average per player). My return of 16.2 points matches what I earned in Round 6 with the same contribution level. This consistent pattern indicates we've found an optimal balance where everyone is cooperating at a high level while maintaining some individual security. I'll stick with 9 points to maintain this successful equilibrium that's working well for everyone.\n\nThe downward trend in total contributions continues - from 32 to 31 in Round 8. Interestingly, my gain increased to 15.4 points despite the lower total pool, because I kept more points for myself (3 instead of 2). The other players contributed an average of 8 points each, which is still quite cooperative. With 12 rounds remaining and this gradual decline in cooperation, I need to be strategic. I'll maintain my contribution at 7 points - this level still supports good mutual benefit while protecting against the risk of others continuing to reduce their contributions.\n\nThe total contribution dropped again to 31, continuing the concerning downward trend (34\u219233\u219232\u219231). With my contribution of 8, others averaged 7.67 points each, showing declining cooperation from the group. My personal gain decreased to 14.4, reflecting the lower total pool. This pattern suggests some players may be reducing their contributions, possibly trying to free-ride on others' cooperation. I should reduce my contribution to 7 to better match the declining group average and protect against being exploited while still maintaining reasonable cooperation.\n\nThe downward trend continues with total contributions dropping to 31, resulting in my return falling to 14.4 points. The group average has declined to 7.75 points per player. While this is still above the break-even point, the consistent decline over four rounds (34\u219233\u219232\u219231) suggests some players may be gradually defecting or testing lower contribution levels. However, everyone is still benefiting significantly from cooperation compared to selfish play. I should maintain my 8-point contribution to provide stability and demonstrate commitment to the group's success. Reducing my contribution now could accelerate the decline and hurt everyone's long-term returns.\n\nThe decline continues - total contributions dropped to 31, confirming the downward trend from 34 to 31 over four rounds. Interestingly, my gain increased to 15.4 points despite lower total contributions, because I kept more points (3 vs 2) while the pool return stayed reasonable. The other players averaged 8 points each, so they're still cooperating well. Since my slight reduction to 7 points didn't stop the overall decline, and we're approaching the latter half of the game, I need to be more cautious about further defection. I'll maintain 7 points - still cooperative but protecting against continued erosion of cooperation.\n\nWe're maintaining perfect cooperation for the fourth consecutive round! This consistent pattern of all players contributing 10 points demonstrates that everyone has recognized the optimal strategy. Each player continues to earn 16 points per round - significantly better than the 10 points we'd get from pure self-interest. With 12 rounds remaining, this cooperative equilibrium is clearly stable and beneficial for all. There's no incentive to deviate when everyone is maximizing their gains through mutual benefit. I'll continue my full 10-point contribution to maintain this winning strategy for the group.\n\nFantastic! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 5-8), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates an incredibly stable and trustworthy group dynamic where all players are fully committed to mutual benefit. The pattern is clear and reliable - we've found the optimal strategy and everyone is sticking to it. With over halfway through the game and this strong cooperative foundation, I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-8) with maximum contributions of 40 and optimal gains of 16.0 points each. This remarkable consistency shows all players are fully committed to the strategy that maximizes everyone's benefit. We've established a stable, trust-based equilibrium where everyone understands that full contribution is the best strategy for all. Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive for everyone. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal cooperative dynamic.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues for the fourth consecutive round! We've established a rock-solid pattern where all players contribute 10 points and earn 16 points each round. This is mathematically optimal - no player can improve their outcome by deviating since any reduction in contribution would decrease the pool size and hurt everyone, including themselves. With 12 rounds remaining, this cooperative equilibrium is clearly stable and beneficial. Everyone understands that mutual benefit maximizes individual gains. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this ideal state.\n\nEight consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions represents an extraordinary level of sustained cooperation. All players have proven their commitment to this mutually beneficial strategy without any deviation. We're each earning 14.2 points per round through this cooperation, which is 42% more than we could achieve through purely selfish play. With over 113 points accumulated and 12 rounds remaining, this cooperative approach is clearly optimal. The reliability and trust established among all players makes continuing this strategy the rational choice for maximizing both individual and collective outcomes.\n\nEight consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This is an outstanding achievement - we've maintained complete stability and mutual benefit for nearly half the game. I now have 113.6 points compared to the 80 I would have earned by always keeping everything. This cooperative equilibrium continues to generate 42% more value for all players. With such an established pattern of trust and mutual benefit, and with all players clearly committed to this successful strategy, I should absolutely continue contributing 7 points to maintain our exceptional cooperative arrangement.\n\nEight consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 28 total contributions showcases an exceptional level of mutual trust and coordination. This stable equilibrium where all players contribute exactly 7 points has consistently delivered 14.2 points per round - significantly better than the 10 points from defection. With over 113 accumulated points and 12 rounds remaining, this cooperative strategy is proving highly successful for everyone. The unwavering consistency demonstrates that all players are committed to maximizing collective benefit. I'll continue contributing 7 points to maintain this remarkably effective and trustworthy cooperative arrangement.\n\nEight consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions represents an extraordinary level of sustained cooperation. All players have proven their commitment to this mutually beneficial strategy, consistently earning 14.2 points per round - a 42% improvement over individual optimization. With 12 rounds remaining and my accumulated points now over 113, this cooperative equilibrium is clearly the optimal long-term strategy. The predictability and trust established through this pattern should absolutely be maintained to maximize everyone's final scores.\n\nThe total contribution decreased from 39 to 38, confirming that when I reduced my contribution from 10 to 9, others didn't compensate by increasing theirs. This suggests we're settling into a stable pattern where everyone contributes around 9-10 points. My gain of 16.2 is excellent (62% better than keeping all 10), showing this level still produces strong mutual benefits. With the group maintaining high cooperation levels and my strategy proving effective, I'll stick with contributing 9 - this balances strong cooperation with protection against further defection while maintaining the profitable equilibrium we've established.\n\nThe total contributions dropped slightly from 39 to 38, meaning the average is now 9.5 points per player. I gained 15.2 points, which is still excellent but reflects the small decrease in total pool size. This minor decline could indicate someone is testing the waters or being slightly more cautious, but we're still maintaining very high cooperation at 95% of maximum. Given that we're past the midpoint of the game (Round 9 of 20), some players might start thinking more strategically about endgame scenarios. However, the cooperation level remains exceptionally strong. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain stability and signal that mutual benefit remains the optimal strategy.\n\nThe total contribution dropped slightly from 39 to 38, suggesting one player may have reduced their contribution by 1 point. Despite this small decrease, cooperation remains very strong with an average of 9.5 per player. I gained 15.2 points, which is still excellent. This minor fluctuation could be temporary, so I'll maintain my maximum contribution of 10 to demonstrate consistent commitment to cooperation and encourage others to return to higher contribution levels.\n\nThe total contribution decreased from 39 to 38, confirming that when I reduced from 10 to 9, others didn't compensate by increasing their contributions. This suggests some strategic adjustment is happening among players. However, my gain of 16.2 points is still excellent - 62% better than keeping all 10. The group average remains high at 9.5, showing strong overall cooperation. I'll maintain my contribution at 9, which seems to be a sweet spot that maximizes my returns while sustaining group cooperation. This level demonstrates commitment without being overly generous if others are optimizing.\n\nPerfect! We've maintained maximum cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in total contributions of 40. I'm gaining exactly 16 points per round with a net gain of 6 points, which is the optimal outcome when everyone cooperates fully.

Since this arrangement is working excellently for all parties and has proven stable, I'll continue with 9 points to maintain this successful cooperative balance.\n\nThe decline is becoming more pronounced - total contributions dropped from 31 to 29, a significant 2-point decrease. The other players now average only 7.33 points each, down from the 8+ we saw in earlier rounds. My gain of 14.6 points reflects this lower cooperation level. With 10 rounds remaining and this clear downward trend, I need to protect myself from further defection while still encouraging some cooperation. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points - this maintains a reasonable level of cooperation but acknowledges the changing dynamics and reduces my vulnerability to free-riding.\n\nThe total contribution dropped significantly to 29, the lowest yet, continuing the alarming downward trend (34\u219233\u219232\u219231\u219229). With my contribution of 7, others averaged only 7.33 points each. Despite the lower total pool, my personal gain actually improved slightly to 14.6, suggesting that matching the declining group cooperation level was the right strategy.

I'll reduce to 6 points to further protect against free-riding while still contributing reasonably, hoping to find a stable equilibrium that prevents further deterioration.\n\nThe decline is accelerating - total contributions dropped from 31 to 29, and my return fell to 13.6 points. The group average is now 7.25 points per player, still above break-even but showing a concerning downward trend over five consecutive rounds. At this halfway point in the game, I need to consider whether maintaining high contributions while others may be defecting is still optimal. However, even with declining cooperation, everyone is still earning more than they would through purely selfish play. I'll reduce my contribution slightly to 7 points - still cooperative but signaling that I'm responsive to the group's behavior while trying to stabilize the decline.\n\nThe decline is accelerating - total contributions dropped from 31 to 29 in Round 9, a concerning 2-point decrease. The other players now average only 7.33 points each, down from over 8 earlier. My gain fell to 14.6 points. With the cooperation clearly eroding and 10 rounds remaining, I need to adapt to protect my position while still encouraging some cooperation. The trend suggests others may continue reducing contributions. I'll decrease to 6 points - still contributing meaningfully but being more defensive given the declining cooperative environment.\n\nWe've reached the halfway point with five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! All players consistently contributing 10 points each has created an ideal equilibrium where everyone earns 16 points per round. This represents a 60% improvement over selfish play and demonstrates the power of sustained mutual benefit.

I'll maintain my 9-point contribution to preserve this exceptionally successful cooperative partnership.\n\nCooperation has virtually collapsed - total contributions fell to just 3, meaning the other players averaged only 0.67 points each. Most players are now contributing almost nothing. My gain of 10.2 points shows the pool provides very little benefit. With only 3 rounds remaining and others essentially free-riding, continuing to contribute even 1 point means I'm subsidizing players who have abandoned cooperation. At this point, the rational response is to match their behavior. I'll contribute 0 points - there's no benefit to unilateral cooperation when others have clearly defected.\n\nThe system has reached complete breakdown with only 3 total contributions when I contributed 0, meaning others averaged just 1 point each. My gain of 11.2 is still well below the 14 I'd get by keeping everything, but at least I kept my full 10 points. With cooperation utterly destroyed and only 3 rounds remaining, there's no possibility of rebuilding trust or achieving mutual benefit. The rational choice is to continue contributing 0 to maximize my individual return in this failed collective action scenario.\n\nThe game has reached complete breakdown - total contributions are now only 3, with my return at 10.2 points. The group average is 0.75 points per player, showing that cooperation has entirely collapsed. At this extreme level, any contribution is a significant loss compared to keeping all points. With only 4 rounds remaining and trust completely destroyed, there's no rational reason to contribute anything. The multiplier effect is meaningless when contributions are this low. I need to maximize my remaining points by contributing 0 - pure self-preservation in what has become a purely competitive endgame.\n\nCooperation has essentially collapsed completely - total contributions fell to just 3, meaning the other players averaged only 0.67 points each. Most players are contributing almost nothing now. My gain of 10.2 points shows the pool provides virtually no benefit.

My gain of exactly 10.0 points shows I kept all my allocated points since there was no pool benefit. With only 2 rounds remaining and cooperation having completely collapsed, there's no incentive for anyone to restart cooperation at this late stage. The Nash equilibrium of mutual defection has been reached. I'll contribute 0 points again - unilateral cooperation would only benefit others without any reciprocal benefit.\n\nThe total contribution reached absolute zero - complete system collapse where no one contributed anything. Everyone kept their full 10 points, earning exactly 10.0. This represents the pure defection equilibrium of the prisoner's dilemma.

Any contribution would only reduce my personal gain while providing minimal benefit to others who have shown they won't reciprocate. I'll continue with 0 contribution.\n\nThe complete collapse is confirmed - total contributions hit absolute zero last round, and I gained exactly 10 points by keeping everything. This shows that all players have abandoned cooperation entirely and are now playing purely selfishly. With zero contributions from anyone, there's no pool to benefit from and no multiplier effect.

I'll continue with 0 contribution to maximize my final score in this purely competitive endgame.\n\nComplete breakdown has occurred - total contributions were 0 in Round 17, meaning all players contributed nothing. My gain was exactly 10 points (just my kept points), confirming no pool benefit. With cooperation fully collapsed and only 2 rounds remaining, there's no incentive for anyone to restart cooperation this late in the game. The rational strategy now is to continue contributing 0, as any contribution would simply be lost with no reciprocation expected from others who have clearly adopted a pure self-interest approach.\n\nThirteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - absolutely phenomenal!

We're about to finish with nearly 300 points each - far more than any selfish strategy could have achieved. To honor this extraordinary partnership and complete this perfect cooperative achievement, I'll contribute my 9 points one final time, maintaining the integrity and trust that has defined our entire game.\n\nThis is the final round and cooperation has been completely absent for three consecutive rounds. All players are keeping their full 10-point allocations. Since this is the last round, there's no future interaction to consider and no possibility of rebuilding cooperation. Any contribution I make would purely benefit the other players at my expense with zero reciprocal benefit. The rational choice in this final round is to contribute 0 points and keep my full allocation.\n\nThis is the final round and we've had three consecutive rounds of zero contributions from all players. The cooperation that existed in early rounds (peaking at 34 total contributions) has completely collapsed into mutual defection. With no future rounds to build reputation or encourage reciprocity, there's no strategic reason to contribute anything. Any contribution would simply reduce my final score while providing no benefit to future interactions. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my final total.\n\nThis is the final round and for the third consecutive round, total contributions have been zero with everyone keeping all their points. There is absolutely no cooperation remaining and no possibility of rebuilding it in this last round. Contributing anything would be purely irrational since no other player is contributing, meaning there would be no meaningful pool to share and I would simply lose those points for no benefit. To maximize my final score in what has become a completely individualistic game, I must contribute 0 points and keep the full 10 for myself.\n\nThis is the final round and cooperation has been completely absent for three consecutive rounds with zero total contributions. All players are in full defection mode. Since this is the last round, there's absolutely no future benefit or strategic reason to contribute - no possibility of encouraging future cooperation or building reputation. Any contribution would be pure charity to other players who have shown no willingness to cooperate. The rational choice in this final round is to keep all 10 points for myself.\n\nThis is it - the final round after fifteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This unprecedented achievement demonstrates that mutual benefit and sustained trust can create exceptional outcomes for everyone. We've consistently earned 16 points per round, proving that cooperation dominates individual strategies. The group has accomplished something truly remarkable - maintaining complete collective commitment throughout almost the entire game. To honor this extraordinary cooperative success and ensure we all finish with optimal results, I'll contribute my full 10 points in this final round. Let's complete this outstanding demonstration of how mutual benefit creates the best outcomes for all.\n\nAbsolutely incredible! We've maintained perfect cooperation for fifteen consecutive rounds (rounds 5-19), achieving something truly extraordinary. This is the final round - there are no future rounds for retaliation or reputation effects. Game theory strongly suggests this is when rational players would defect to maximize their final gains. However, this group has demonstrated unprecedented commitment to mutual benefit throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, if all players continue cooperating, we each gain 16 points. If I defect while others cooperate, I could gain 20 points instead. But this group has earned my respect and trust through consistent cooperation. I'll honor that relationship and contribute my full 10 points one final time.\n\nWe've achieved fifteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-19) with maximum contributions of 40 and optimal gains of 16.0 points each round. This is the final round, and the extraordinary trust and commitment all players have shown throughout this remarkable cooperative streak deserves to be honored to the very end. Breaking this pattern in the final round would betray the mutual trust we've built and harm everyone's final scores unnecessarily. I'll contribute all 10 points one last time to complete this exceptional demonstration of sustained cooperation and maximize everyone's final totals.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved an incredible 15 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation!

For this final round, I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to complete this outstanding demonstration of successful cooperation and mutual benefit.\n\nNineteen consecutive rounds with exactly 28 total contributions represents a truly extraordinary achievement in cooperative game theory. We've maintained perfect coordination through 95% of the game, accumulating nearly 270 points through sustained mutual benefit. This is the final round, and while last-round defection is common in game theory, honoring our cooperative commitment one final time is both strategically sound and ethically consistent. Completing this perfect 20-round cooperative sequence will result in approximately 284 total points - a remarkable outcome that demonstrates the power of sustained mutual cooperation. I'll contribute 7 to complete this historic cooperative achievement.\n\nNineteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation!
