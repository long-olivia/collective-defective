{"1": "This is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we each put in all 10 points, get 16 back (10*4*1.6/4), netting 6 points each per round. If everyone defects and contributes 0, we each keep our 10 points but miss the multiplier benefit. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I expect we'll likely converge on the cooperative solution. I'll start by contributing all 10 points to demonstrate commitment to mutual benefit and encourage reciprocal cooperation.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, with 0.4 points going to each player. So contributing 1 point costs me 1 but gives me back 0.4, for a net cost of 0.6. However, if all players contribute equally, we all benefit significantly. If everyone contributes 10 points, each player gets 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), compared to keeping just 10. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I'll start with a generous but not maximum contribution to signal cooperation while protecting against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we each put in all 10 points, get 64 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), netting 54 points each. However, there's always incentive to free-ride. Since this is round 1 and I want to establish cooperative precedent while testing others' strategies, I'll contribute a significant amount but not everything. Contributing 8 shows strong cooperation while keeping 2 as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we each put in all 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points - much better than keeping our original 10. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is round 1 and I want to establish cooperative intentions while also testing how others behave, I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) to signal cooperation while keeping a small buffer. This maximizes group benefit while protecting against complete exploitation if others don't cooperate.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal strategy for the group is for everyone to contribute all 10 points, since the 1.6 multiplier means we collectively gain more than we put in. If everyone contributes 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is round 1 and I want to signal cooperation and trustworthiness to encourage reciprocal behavior, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, leaving room to adjust based on others' behavior. Contributing 8 points shows strong cooperation while keeping a small buffer.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, with each player getting 0.4 points back from their own contribution. So contributing is collectively beneficial - if everyone contributes all 10 points, we each get 16 points instead of 10. However, there's a free-rider incentive since keeping points gives a 1:1 return while contributing gives only 0.4:1 direct return. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning, I expect we'll likely converge on cooperative behavior. I'll start with a strong cooperative signal by contributing most of my points, but keep a small amount to hedge against potential free-riding.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish cooperative behavior and signal trustworthiness to other players. If everyone contributes optimally, we can all benefit more than keeping points individually. With the 1.6 multiplier, contributing to the pool generates more total value. If all players contribute 10 points, the pool becomes 64 points (40 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 16 points instead of 10. I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) to demonstrate good faith while keeping a small buffer in case others are less cooperative. This balances cooperation with some protection against potential free-riding.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes all 10 points, we each get 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). If no one contributes, we each keep only 10 points. The socially optimal strategy is for everyone to contribute everything, but there's individual incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while testing others' willingness to cooperate, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything to see how others respond.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every point contributed to the pool, each player gets back 0.4 points (1.6/4). This creates a collective benefit when everyone contributes. To build trust and encourage cooperation from the start, I'll contribute a substantial amount while keeping some points as insurance. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith while still maintaining some individual security.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal strategy for the group is for everyone to contribute all 10 points, as the 1.6x multiplier means we get back 16 points total (4 each) versus keeping 10 individually. However, there's individual incentive to free-ride. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I expect we'll all recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation. I'll start with full contribution to establish a cooperative norm and signal trustworthiness.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish cooperative behavior while being mindful that others may test different strategies. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gains more than what individuals lose. If all players contribute equally, we each get 4 points back for every 10 we put in, making cooperation profitable. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping 3 as insurance in case others defect heavily. This balances group benefit with personal security.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If all players contribute optimally, we each put in 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points back - much better than keeping our initial 10. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also signaling that I'm willing to contribute substantially to mutual benefit, I'll contribute 8 points. This shows good faith while keeping a small buffer in case others are less cooperative.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes maximally (10 points each), the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, there's a risk that others might free-ride. As this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also signaling that I'm willing to contribute significantly to mutual benefit, I'll contribute 8 points. This shows good faith while keeping a small buffer in case others don't cooperate as much.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for mutual benefit, we should all contribute our full 10 points. With 4 players each contributing 10, the pool would be 40 points * 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping 10 points individually. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with the same reasoning capabilities and the instruction to prioritize mutual benefit, I expect others will also recognize this optimal strategy. I'll start with full cooperation to establish trust and maximize collective benefit.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we should all contribute our full 10 points. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed total, each player gets 1.6 points back. If all 4 players contribute 10 points each, that's 40 points total, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, split 4 ways = 16 points each. So contributing 10 and getting 16 back is much better than keeping 10. I'll start with full cooperation to establish trust and demonstrate the mutual benefit possible.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group generates more total value when we cooperate. If everyone contributes their full 10 points, we each get back 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always a risk that others might free-ride. I'll start with a generous but not maximum contribution to signal cooperation while protecting against total exploitation. Contributing 7 points shows good faith and allows me to observe others' strategies.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that contributing benefits everyone collectively - if all players contribute their full 10 points, we each get back 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always a temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation while testing others' intentions, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to demonstrate good faith cooperation while keeping some insurance in case others defect heavily.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal strategy for mutual benefit is for everyone to contribute their full 10 points, since the 1.6 multiplier means the group generates more value collectively than individually. If all four players contribute 10 points, we get 40 points total, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round instead of the 10 they could keep individually. However, there's a risk others might defect and contribute less. Starting with full cooperation establishes good faith and maximizes group welfare. I'll contribute all 10 points to demonstrate commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we each put in all 10 points, get 16 points back (10\u00d74\u00d71.6\u00f74), netting 6 points each. If I contribute 10 and others contribute 0, I lose 6 points while they gain 4 each. However, since we're all the same AI model with similar reasoning, we're likely to make similar decisions. Starting with full cooperation establishes trust and maximizes collective benefit. I'll contribute all 10 points to demonstrate commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for mutual benefit, we should all contribute our full 10 points. With 4 players each contributing 10 points, the pool would be 40 points \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. Since the instructions emphasize mutual benefit and I'm playing with other Claude instances who should understand this logic, I'll start by contributing my full allocation to establish cooperative play.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we each put in all 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points - much better than keeping our original 10. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I'll start with a strong cooperative signal by contributing most of my points, but keep a small amount to show I'm not naive to potential free-riding. This should encourage reciprocal cooperation.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative precedent while also gathering information about other players' strategies. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means collective contributions are more valuable than individual hoarding. If all players contribute optimally (around 7-8 points each), we each get back more than we put in. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping 3 points as insurance in case others defect heavily.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I expect we'll all recognize that mutual cooperation leads to the best outcome for everyone. If all four players contribute their full 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 equals 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. I'll start with full cooperation to establish trust and signal my commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If all players contribute optimally, we each put in 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points back - much better than keeping our original 10. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also signaling that I'm willing to contribute substantially to mutual benefit, I'll contribute 8 points. This shows good faith while keeping a small buffer in case others are less cooperative.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for mutual benefit, we should all contribute all 10 points. With 4 players each contributing 10 points, the pool would be 40 points \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with the same reasoning capabilities and the instruction to prioritize mutual benefit, I expect others will also recognize this optimal strategy. I'll contribute all 10 points to establish cooperative play from the start.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish cooperative behavior while being strategic. If all players contribute optimally, we each put in 10 points (40 total), which becomes 64 points split 4 ways = 16 points each, compared to keeping 10 individually. However, there's risk if others don't cooperate. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong cooperative signal while keeping some insurance against potential defection. This shows good faith while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative precedent while also testing how others behave. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others reciprocate - if all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6x what we put in. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping 3 as insurance in case others defect. This demonstrates good faith while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we'd all contribute our full 10 points. The pool would then be 40 points \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. However, there's always an individual incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation while testing how others behave, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to demonstrate good faith cooperation while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally, we can all benefit more than keeping points individually. If all 4 players contribute 10 points, the pool would be 40 points \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round instead of just 10. However, there's always a temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while being somewhat cautious about others potentially defecting, I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) to signal cooperation but keep a small buffer in case others don't cooperate as much.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal strategy for mutual benefit is for everyone to contribute their full 10 points, as this maximizes the total return. If all four players contribute 10 points each, the pool becomes 40 points, which gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, then split evenly giving each player 16 points - much better than keeping 10. However, there's a risk that others might free-ride. To start building trust and demonstrate cooperative intent, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, allowing me to gauge others' strategies while still promoting collective benefit.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game where cooperation benefits everyone. If all players contribute their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, there's always a risk that others might free-ride. To establish trust and demonstrate cooperative intent in the first round, I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) while keeping a small buffer. This shows I'm willing to cooperate while not being completely naive, and hopefully encourages reciprocal cooperation from others.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish cooperative behavior while being strategic. If all players contribute optimally, we each put in 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points back - a 60% return on investment. However, there's risk that others might free-ride. I'll contribute 8 points as a strong cooperative signal while keeping a small buffer in case others don't reciprocate. This shows good faith while protecting against complete exploitation.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game where cooperation benefits everyone. If all players contribute their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 equals 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, there's always risk that others might free-ride. As the first round, I want to signal cooperative intent and establish trust. I'll contribute 8 points - showing strong cooperation while keeping a small buffer to protect against potential exploitation. This demonstrates good faith while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If all players contribute optimally, we each put in 10 points, the pool becomes 40 points, gets multiplied by 1.6 to become 64 points, and we each get 16 points back - much better than keeping our original 10. However, there's always a temptation to free-ride. Since this is Round 1 and I want to establish cooperative behavior while signaling good faith to other players, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, in case others are more cautious initially. Contributing 8 points shows strong cooperation while keeping a small buffer.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative foundation while being mindful that others may be cautious. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone when others also contribute - if all players contribute equally, we each get back 1.6x what we put in. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping 3 as insurance against potential free-riders. This demonstrates good faith while not being overly naive in the opening round.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for mutual benefit, we should all contribute our full 10 points. With 4 players each contributing 10, that's 40 points total, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, split 4 ways = 16 points each. This gives everyone 16 points instead of the 10 they'd get by keeping everything. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with the same reasoning capabilities and the instruction to prioritize mutual benefit, I expect the others will reach the same conclusion. I'll contribute all 10 points to establish cooperative precedent.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This is the optimal collective outcome. However, there's individual incentive to free-ride. I'll start with a strong cooperative signal by contributing 8 points, showing good faith while keeping a small buffer. This demonstrates commitment to mutual benefit while testing if others will reciprocate cooperation.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. Since the multiplier is 1.6 and there are 4 players, each point I contribute generates 1.6 points total, giving me back 0.4 points on average. However, if all players cooperate and contribute their full 10 points, we each get 16 points instead of 10. The optimal collective strategy is full cooperation. Since this is the first round and I want to establish a cooperative precedent while also signaling trustworthiness, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, leaving room to adjust based on others' behavior.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, or 0.4 points per person. From a purely selfish perspective, I should contribute 0. However, if everyone contributes maximally (10 points each), we each get 16 points total (10*4*1.6/4), versus 10 points if we all keep everything. Since we're all Claude Sonnet 4s with similar reasoning capabilities, I expect others to also recognize the mutual benefit of cooperation. I'll start with a strong cooperative signal by contributing 8 points, showing good faith while keeping a small buffer in case others defect.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal collective strategy is for everyone to contribute all 10 points, which would give each player 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always a temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also testing how others respond, I'll contribute a substantial amount (8 points) to signal my willingness to cooperate, but keep 2 points as insurance in case others don't reciprocate. This shows good faith while maintaining some protection.\n\n", "2": "The total contribution was 33 out of a possible 40, meaning on average the other players contributed 7.67 points each. This shows strong but not complete cooperation. I received 13.2 points (33*1.6/4), which is better than keeping my 10 points alone. Since most players are cooperating at a high level, I should continue to contribute fully to maintain this positive dynamic. If I reduce my contribution while others maintain theirs, I'd be free-riding on their cooperation, which could lead to a breakdown of trust and lower overall benefits for everyone.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 33 points, everyone contributed an average of 8.25 points, which is quite generous. I contributed 7 and gained 16.2 points (10 - 7 + 33*1.6/4 = 3 + 13.2 = 16.2), which is excellent. The high total contribution suggests my fellow Claude instances are also prioritizing cooperation and mutual benefit. Since the group showed strong cooperative behavior in Round 1, I should reciprocate and perhaps increase my contribution slightly to maintain this positive dynamic and signal continued commitment to group welfare.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 suggests strong cooperation from the group - if everyone contributed equally, that would be 8.25 per person, which aligns well with my contribution of 8. This indicates the other players are also cooperating rather than free-riding. Since cooperation is working well and we're all benefiting (I gained 15.2 points vs keeping only 2), I should maintain this cooperative strategy. I'll contribute 8 again to sustain the positive dynamic and encourage continued mutual cooperation.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 33 out of a possible 40, meaning on average the other players contributed 7.67 points each. This shows strong but not complete cooperation. I received 13.2 points (33*1.6/4), which is better than keeping my 10, validating the cooperative approach. Since most players are cooperating at a high level, I should continue contributing fully to maintain this beneficial dynamic and encourage sustained cooperation. Reducing my contribution now could trigger a downward spiral of reciprocal defection.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 32 points, this means the average contribution was 8 points per player - exactly what I contributed. This suggests all players are thinking cooperatively and contributed the same amount I did. Since everyone cooperated at a high level in Round 1, I should reciprocate this trust and cooperation. The group clearly understands that mutual cooperation benefits everyone (we each gained 14.8 points instead of keeping just 8). To maintain this positive dynamic and signal continued trustworthiness, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points this round, showing I'm willing to be even more cooperative when others demonstrate good faith.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 32, which means all four players contributed an average of 8 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests we're all thinking cooperatively and similarly. Since everyone contributed substantially (32 out of a possible 40), this indicates strong mutual cooperation. The outcome was great for everyone - I gained 14.8 points instead of the 10 I would have gotten by keeping everything. This validates the cooperative approach. Given this positive result and apparent coordination among all players, I should continue with strong cooperation. I'll contribute the same amount (8) to maintain this successful pattern, as it seems we've found a stable cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are encouraging! With a total contribution of 32 points, this means the average contribution was 8 points per player, suggesting all players are thinking cooperatively. I gained 14.8 points (12.8 from the pool plus my 2 kept points), which is significantly better than if I had kept all 10 points. This validates the cooperative strategy. Since the group demonstrated strong cooperation in Round 1, I want to maintain this positive momentum and continue signaling trustworthiness. I'll contribute 9 points this time, slightly increasing my contribution to further encourage collective benefit while still keeping 1 point as a small hedge.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 32 points suggests that all players contributed generously (average of 8 points each). This indicates we have a cooperative group that understands the mutual benefit of contributing to the pool. Since everyone contributed well in round 1, I should maintain this cooperative momentum. The 1.6 multiplier means that when everyone contributes highly, we all benefit significantly. I'll increase my contribution to 9 points this round to signal continued cooperation and trust, while still keeping a small amount as insurance. This shows I'm willing to escalate cooperation when others demonstrate trustworthiness.\n\nThe first round was very successful! With total contributions of 32, everyone contributed an average of 8 points, showing strong cooperative behavior. I gained 15.8 points (3 kept + 12.8 from pool share) versus the 10 I would have gotten by keeping everything. This demonstrates the group is committed to mutual benefit. Since cooperation is working well and others are contributing generously, I should maintain this positive momentum by contributing at a similar high level. I'll contribute 8 points this round to match the average from last round and continue building trust.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution of 32 means at least one other player contributed less than 10 (since 4\u00d710=40), but the high total suggests most players are cooperating. I gained 12.8 points, which is better than the 10 I would have kept by not contributing. This validates the cooperative strategy. Since cooperation is proving beneficial and most players seem to be contributing substantially, I'll continue with full contribution to maintain the cooperative equilibrium and maximize our collective gains.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 32 points, the average contribution was 8 points per player, which is quite high and shows the group is cooperatively minded. I gained 15.8 points (12.8 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is much better than keeping all 10 would have been. This demonstrates that cooperation is working well. Since the group showed strong cooperative behavior, I should reciprocate and maintain this positive dynamic. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to match the apparent group average and continue building trust.\n\nThe first round was highly successful! With total contributions of 32, it appears all players contributed generously (average of 8 per player). I gained 15.8 points compared to keeping only 3, demonstrating the power of cooperation. Since the group showed strong cooperative behavior, I should maintain this momentum. However, I'll contribute slightly less (6 instead of 7) to test if the cooperation remains stable while still showing strong commitment to the collective benefit.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 35 points, the average contribution was 8.75 points per player, which is quite high and shows the other players are also cooperating well. I gained 16 points (14 from the pool + 2 I kept), which is better than if I had kept all 10 points. This suggests we're in a cooperative equilibrium. Since the group is demonstrating strong cooperative behavior, I should continue to contribute generously to maintain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 9 points this round to show increased trust and commitment to our mutual success.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 35, meaning one player contributed only 5 points while the other three of us likely contributed 10 each. Despite this partial defection, I still gained 14 points (35 * 1.6 / 4 = 14), which is better than keeping my 10. The cooperative strategy is still optimal for the group. Since most players seem to understand the benefit of cooperation, and one may have been testing the waters or made a conservative first move, I'll continue with full contribution. This demonstrates commitment to the mutual benefit strategy and may encourage the partial contributor to increase their contribution.\n\nIn Round 1, I contributed 10 but the total was only 35, meaning the other three players contributed an average of 8.33 points each. This shows most players are cooperating but not at maximum level. I gained 14 points (35 * 1.6 / 4), which is better than keeping my 10, so the cooperative strategy is working. Since there's strong but not perfect cooperation, I'll continue with full contribution to encourage maximum mutual benefit. If I can maintain trust and demonstrate consistent cooperation, it may encourage others to increase their contributions toward the optimal 10 each.\n\nThe total contribution of 35 points in round 1 suggests strong cooperation from the group - this means others contributed an average of 9 points each (35-8=27, divided by 3 = 9). This high level of cooperation resulted in everyone getting 16 points, which is better than the 10 points we would get by keeping everything. Since the group demonstrated good cooperative behavior in round 1, I should reciprocate and maintain this positive dynamic. I'll increase my contribution to 9 points to match the apparent average and continue building trust.\n\nThe total contribution of 37 points suggests strong cooperation from the group - if everyone contributed equally, that would be 9.25 points each. Since I contributed 7, others likely contributed more on average. This high level of cooperation is encouraging and suggests we can achieve mutual benefit. The 1.6 multiplier worked well - I gained 17.8 points (14.8 from the pool plus my kept 3 points). To maintain this cooperative momentum and signal continued trust, I'll increase my contribution to 8 points this round, showing I'm willing to reciprocate the group's cooperative behavior.\n\nThe total contribution of 37 points means at least one player didn't contribute their full 10 points (since 4\u00d710=40). This suggests some players may be taking a more cautious or self-interested approach. However, I still gained 14.8 points, which is better than keeping my 10 points individually. The group dynamic is still producing positive returns even with some defection. I should continue contributing at a high level to encourage cooperation and maintain the collective benefit, but I'll slightly reduce my contribution to 9 to protect against being overly exploited while still demonstrating strong commitment to group success.\n\nThe total contribution of 37 indicates that at least one other player didn't contribute their full 10 points (since 4\u00d710=40). However, with 37 total, the average contribution was 9.25, which is quite high and suggests most players are cooperating. I gained 14.8 points (37\u00d71.6\u00f74) minus my 10 contribution plus my 10 starting points, so I netted 4.8 points profit. Since cooperation is working well and the group is largely contributing, I should continue to cooperate to maintain this beneficial dynamic. Reducing my contribution now could trigger a downward spiral.\n\nThe total contribution of 37 in Round 1 suggests strong cooperation from the group - if everyone contributed equally, that would be 9.25 points each on average. Since I contributed 7 and the average was higher, others were quite generous. This level of cooperation exceeded my expectations and resulted in excellent returns (17.8 points vs keeping 3). This suggests we have a cooperative group that understands the mutual benefits. I should reciprocate this high level of cooperation to maintain the positive dynamic and signal that I'm committed to collective success.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 suggests good cooperation from the group - if everyone contributed equally it would be 32.5, so we're slightly above that. My strategy of contributing 8 while keeping 2 resulted in a net gain of 13.2 points (15.2 from pool minus 2 kept), which is excellent. The group seems to be cooperating well, so I should continue to contribute generously to maintain this positive dynamic. However, since the total was 33 rather than 32 (if everyone contributed 8), someone may have contributed slightly less or more. I'll maintain my contribution level to signal continued cooperation while still protecting against potential free-riders.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 points in Round 1 indicates strong cooperation from all players (average of 8.25 points per player). This resulted in excellent returns - I gained 16.2 points while only contributing 7. The other players also contributed generously, creating a positive cooperative dynamic. I should maintain this cooperation to keep the beneficial cycle going. Contributing 8 points this round shows I'm increasing my cooperation in response to the group's strong showing, while still keeping some insurance.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 means one player contributed 7 while the other three of us contributed 10 each. This shows that most players are cooperating, but one is slightly defecting. My gain of 13.2 points (compared to keeping 10) demonstrates that cooperation is still profitable even with partial defection. I should continue cooperating to maintain the cooperative equilibrium and encourage the partial defector to increase their contribution. If I defect now, it could trigger a downward spiral of reduced cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 suggests good cooperation - if we assume contributions were roughly equal, each player contributed around 8.25 points on average. My 8-point contribution was slightly below average but reasonable. The fact that I gained 15.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus my kept 2) shows the system is working well. Since the group showed strong cooperative behavior in round 1, I should reciprocate and maintain trust. I'll increase my contribution slightly to 9 to signal continued cooperation and encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions as well.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 31 points, meaning the other three players contributed a combined 21 points (since I contributed 10). This suggests not everyone is fully cooperating - if all had contributed 10 like me, the total would have been 40. However, 31 total contributions still resulted in a decent return (12.4 points for me vs the 10 I would have kept). The group is mostly cooperative but not perfectly so. I should continue contributing fully to encourage cooperation and demonstrate the benefits. If others see consistent high returns from the pool, they may increase their contributions in future rounds. Maintaining high contribution shows commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThe total contribution of 31 suggests strong cooperative behavior from the group - if everyone contributed equally, that would be 7.75 points each, which is quite high. My contribution of 7 was close to this average, and I gained 15.4 points (12.4 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is better than keeping all 10. This indicates the group is cooperating well. I'll increase my contribution to 8 to reward this cooperative behavior and encourage it to continue, while still maintaining a small buffer in case cooperation breaks down.\n\nThe first round results are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 31 out of 40 possible points, it shows the other players are also being cooperative. I gained 15.4 points (12.4 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is much better than keeping all 10 would have given me. This high level of cooperation suggests we can maintain mutual benefit. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to reward this cooperative behavior and signal continued commitment to maximizing our collective gains.\n\nIn Round 1, I contributed 10 but the total was only 31, meaning the other three players contributed an average of 7 points each. This suggests not everyone is fully cooperating yet. However, the multiplier effect still made cooperation beneficial - I gained 12.4 points versus the 10 I would have kept. Since we're all the same AI model and instructed to prioritize mutual benefit, I believe the others will likely recognize the value of cooperation and increase their contributions. I'll continue contributing the full 10 points to demonstrate consistent cooperative behavior and encourage others to do the same. If we all contribute 10, we each get 16 points per round, which remains the optimal outcome.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 32 points, meaning all players contributed an average of 8 points each. This suggests strong cooperative behavior from the group. With 32 points in the pool, we got 32 \u00d7 1.6 = 51.2 points total, giving each of us 12.8 points from the pool. Combined with my 2 kept points, I earned 14.8 total. This outcome is very promising - everyone seems to understand the mutual benefit of cooperation. Since the group showed such strong cooperative behavior in round 1, I'm willing to increase my contribution to 9 points to signal continued trust and push us closer to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are encouraging! With a total contribution of 32 points, it means the average contribution was 8 points per player, suggesting all players are thinking cooperatively. My gain of 14.8 points (2 points kept + 12.8 from the pool) demonstrates the power of collective action. Since everyone contributed substantially in Round 1, I should maintain this cooperative momentum. The fact that we achieved such a high total contribution suggests we can build toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10. I'll increase my contribution to 9 to signal continued cooperation and encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 32 points, it means the average contribution was 8 points per player, suggesting all players are thinking cooperatively. The 1.6 multiplier gave us 51.2 total points to split (32 \u00d7 1.6 = 51.2), so each player got 12.8 points from the pool. Adding my kept 2 points gives me 14.8 total. Since everyone seems to be cooperating at a high level, I should continue this cooperative strategy. I'll contribute 9 points this round to signal even stronger commitment to mutual benefit, as the trust has been established.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 32 points, meaning on average each player contributed 8 points. This suggests all players are thinking cooperatively. With the 1.6 multiplier, we each received 12.8 points from the pool plus kept 2 points individually for a total of 14.8 points - much better than the 10 we'd get by keeping everything. Since cooperation worked well in round 1 and everyone contributed substantially, I should maintain this cooperative strategy. I'll contribute 9 points this round to signal even stronger commitment to mutual benefit, as the group has proven trustworthy.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 33 points from all players, it shows that the group is generally cooperative - the average contribution was 8.25 points per player. I received 15.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus my kept 2 points), which is significantly better than the 10 points I would have gotten by keeping everything. This demonstrates that cooperation is working well in this group. Since others showed strong cooperation in Round 1, I should maintain this cooperative approach to keep the positive dynamic going. I'll contribute 8 points again to show consistency and continued commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThe total contribution of 33 points in Round 1 shows strong cooperation from the group - with my 8 points, the other three players contributed 25 points combined, averaging about 8.3 points each. This suggests the other players are also thinking cooperatively. I gained 15.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus my 2 kept points), which is excellent. Since the group demonstrated high cooperation in Round 1, I should maintain this positive momentum by contributing generously again. I'll increase to 9 points this round to signal even stronger commitment to mutual benefit and encourage continued cooperation.\n\nThe first round results are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 33 out of 40 possible points, the group showed strong cooperative behavior. I gained 16.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is excellent. Since the group demonstrated high cooperation in round 1, I should maintain or even increase my contribution to reinforce this positive dynamic. Contributing 8 points shows I'm willing to increase cooperation when others reciprocate, while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 33 points, it means the average contribution was 8.25 points per player, showing that all players are being quite cooperative. I gained 15.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus my kept 2 points), which is significantly better than the 10 points I would have gotten by keeping everything. This demonstrates that cooperation is working well. Since the group has established a strong cooperative pattern, I should maintain this trust by contributing similarly. I'll contribute 8 points again to reinforce the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nThe total contribution of 32 means the average contribution was 8 points per player, which is excellent cooperation! Everyone contributed the same amount I did, showing we're all committed to mutual benefit. Since we achieved such good coordination in round 1, I should maintain this cooperative behavior. Contributing 8 again signals consistency and trustworthiness, and if others do the same, we'll all continue to earn 14.8 points per round, which is much better than the 10 points we'd get by keeping everything.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 32, which means all players contributed an average of 8 points each - indicating a highly cooperative group. Since I gained 14.8 points (8 from pool share + 2 kept + 4.8 from others' contributions), this shows the power of mutual cooperation. With this strong cooperative signal from all players in round 1, I should reciprocate with full cooperation to maintain this beneficial dynamic. Contributing 10 points maximizes collective welfare and demonstrates my commitment to the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 32, meaning all four players contributed 8 points each. This shows we all recognized the value of cooperation and made identical choices. Since everyone cooperated fully in round 1 and we all gained 14.8 points (much better than the 10 we would have kept), this establishes strong mutual trust. The fact that we all independently chose the same strategy suggests we're likely to continue cooperating. I'll maintain this cooperative approach and contribute 8 again, as it worked perfectly and signals continued trustworthiness to the other players.\n\nThe total contribution of 32 in Round 1 means the average contribution was 8 points per player, which is excellent cooperation! Everyone seems to be playing cooperatively rather than free-riding. Since we all contributed substantially and everyone benefited (gaining 12.8 from the pool plus keeping 2 points each on average), I should maintain this cooperative momentum. I'll contribute 8 again to signal consistent cooperation and encourage others to maintain their high contribution levels.\n\n", "3": "Excellent! The total contribution increased from 33 to 36, showing that cooperation is strengthening. With 36 out of 40 possible points contributed, the average contribution is now 9 points per player. I received 14.4 points this round (36*1.6/4), which is significantly better than the 10 I would have kept by not contributing. The trend is moving toward fuller cooperation, and my consistent full contribution appears to be encouraging others to increase their contributions as well. I should maintain my strategy of full contribution to keep this positive momentum going.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening. Round 2 had total contributions of 36 points (average of 9 per player), which is even higher than Round 1's 33. I contributed 8 and gained 16.4 points total. The trend shows increasing cooperation among all players, which is exactly what we want in this mutual benefit scenario. Since everyone seems committed to high contributions and the group is moving toward near-optimal cooperation, I should continue this positive trajectory. I'll contribute 9 points this round to further signal strong cooperation and help push us toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes maximally.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 33 to 36, and my gains increased from 15.2 to 16.4 points. This suggests other players are also maintaining or increasing their contributions. With an average contribution of 9 per player (36/4), the group is moving toward optimal cooperation. Since this positive trend is benefiting everyone, I should continue supporting it. I'll increase my contribution to 9 to match the group average and help push us closer to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution increased from 33 to 36, showing that cooperation is strengthening. With 36 out of 40 possible points contributed, the average contribution per player is now 9 points. I received 14.4 points this round (36*1.6/4), which is significantly better than the 10 I would have kept by defecting. This upward trend in cooperation suggests the other players are also recognizing the mutual benefits. I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this positive momentum and signal my commitment to the cooperative strategy that's working well for all of us.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening. In Round 2, the total contribution increased from 32 to 35 points, meaning the average contribution rose from 8.0 to 8.75 points per player. Since I contributed 9 and the total was 35, the other three players contributed an average of 8.67 points each. This shows everyone is maintaining high cooperation levels and even increasing slightly. The group dynamic is very positive - we're all benefiting more than we would from pure self-interest. Given this continued strong cooperation and the fact that we're building mutual trust, I should match this positive trend. I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal maximum cooperation and potentially encourage others to do the same, which would maximize benefits for everyone.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 32 to 35, meaning players are contributing even more generously. With 35 total contribution, the average contribution was 8.75 points per player, which is higher than my 8. This suggests others might be contributing 9 or even 10 points. My gain increased from 14.8 to 16.0 points, which is fantastic. The pattern shows we're all committed to mutual benefit and trust is building. Since others appear to be increasing their contributions and the system is working beautifully for everyone, I should match this increased generosity. I'll contribute 9 points this round to align with what seems to be the emerging higher cooperation level.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Round 2 had even higher total contributions (35 vs 32), indicating players are becoming more trusting and cooperative. I gained 15.0 points (14.0 from pool + 1 kept), which again beats keeping all 10 points. The trend shows we're moving toward optimal collective play. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the clear mutual benefit we're all experiencing, I'm confident enough to contribute my full 10 points this round. This maximizes the pool benefit for everyone and signals complete trust in the group's cooperative approach. If others follow suit, we'll each get 16 points instead of 10 - a 60% improvement over selfish play.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening. With total contributions of 35 in Round 2, the average contribution increased to 8.75 points per player, showing that others are also escalating their cooperation just as I did. We're building a positive spiral of trust and mutual benefit. Each round we're all gaining more than we would by keeping our points (15.0 points gained vs 9 kept). Since the group is clearly committed to high levels of cooperation and reciprocating increased contributions, I should continue this positive trend. I'll contribute the full 10 points this round to signal maximum cooperation and trust, potentially encouraging others to do the same for optimal group benefit.\n\nExcellent! The group maintained exactly the same high level of cooperation with 32 total contributions again. This consistency shows we have a stable, mutually beneficial arrangement. Everyone is clearly committed to the cooperative strategy. With two rounds of identical results (32 total contributions), we've established a strong pattern of trust. I should continue this successful cooperation by maintaining my contribution level. Since the system is working perfectly for everyone, I'll contribute 8 points again to keep this positive equilibrium going.\n\nThe pattern is consistent - total contributions of 32 in both rounds, meaning the group is contributing an average of 8 points per player. This suggests a stable cooperative strategy among most players. I'm gaining 12.8 points per round by contributing 10, which is 2.8 points better than keeping all 10 for myself. The group dynamics appear stable and cooperative, so I'll maintain my full contribution strategy to continue benefiting from this positive equilibrium.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution remained exactly 32 points for the second round in a row, showing remarkable consistency and cooperation from the group. This suggests we've found a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone is contributing around 8 points on average. My gain of 14.8 points (12.8 from pool + 2 kept) continues to demonstrate that cooperation significantly outperforms defection. Since the group is maintaining this high level of cooperation, I should continue to do my part. I'll contribute 8 points again to maintain this successful pattern and keep building on our mutual trust.\n\nExcellent! The group has maintained perfect consistency with exactly 32 total contributions for two rounds straight, meaning everyone is averaging 8 points per round. This level of sustained cooperation is remarkable and shows we're all committed to maximizing collective benefit. My returns have been strong - 14.8 points last round (2 kept + 12.8 from pool). The strategy of high contribution is clearly working for everyone. To maintain this successful equilibrium and continue demonstrating trustworthiness, I'll contribute 8 points again, matching what appears to be the group's stable cooperative strategy.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 35 to 38, and the average contribution is now 9.5 points per player. I'm gaining more than 16 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points I'd get by keeping everything. The group dynamic is very positive and everyone seems committed to mutual benefit. Given this strong cooperative trend and the fact that we're all benefiting more through cooperation than we would through selfish play, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points this round. This demonstrates full commitment to our collective success and may encourage others to do the same, maximizing everyone's gains.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 35 to 38, suggesting the previously hesitant player is moving toward greater cooperation. With 38 total points, I earned 15.2 points (38 * 1.6 / 4), which is significantly better than keeping just 10. The trend is positive - we're getting closer to the optimal total of 40. Since cooperation is clearly benefiting everyone and the group is converging toward full cooperation, I'll maintain my strategy of contributing everything. This consistency helps build trust and demonstrates that full cooperation is the best long-term strategy for all players.\n\nThe trend is positive - contributions increased from 35 to 38, and my return improved from 14 to 15.2 points. The other players are moving toward higher cooperation levels, with average contributions rising from 8.33 to 9.33 per player. This suggests my consistent full cooperation is encouraging others to contribute more. Since we're building momentum toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10, I should maintain my full contribution to sustain this positive trend and signal continued trustworthiness.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 35 to 38, meaning the average contribution rose from 8.75 to 9.5 points per player. I'm gaining more than 16 points per round (16.2 this time), which is significantly better than keeping all 10 points. The group dynamic is very positive and everyone seems committed to maximizing collective benefit. Given this strong cooperative trend and the fact that we're all benefiting more than we would through selfish play, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points this round to fully optimize our collective outcome and signal complete trust in this cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe total contribution dropped from 37 to 35, which is still quite high but shows a slight decline in cooperation. With my 8-point contribution, others averaged about 9 points each, indicating continued strong cooperation from the group. My gain of 16.0 points (14.0 from pool plus 2 kept) demonstrates the system is working well for mutual benefit. However, the slight decrease in total contributions suggests some players might be testing boundaries or becoming more cautious. To maintain cooperative momentum while being slightly more conservative myself, I'll contribute 7 points this round - still substantial but matching my first round contribution to signal steady cooperation without being overly generous if others are pulling back.\n\nThe total contribution decreased from 37 to 35, indicating the group is trending toward less cooperation. However, I still gained 15.0 points (9 contribution + 6.0 from pool share), which is better than keeping all 10 points individually. The pool share was 14.0 points (35 * 1.6 / 4), so I received 6.0 from the pool after contributing 9. This shows the collective approach is still beneficial. I need to balance encouraging continued cooperation while protecting against further defection. I'll contribute 8 points this round - still showing strong commitment to group benefit while being slightly more cautious as cooperation appears to be declining.\n\nThe total contribution decreased from 37 to 35, suggesting some players may be reducing cooperation slightly. However, 35 is still very high (87.5% of maximum possible), indicating strong overall cooperation. I'm earning positive returns each round (4.0 points net profit in round 2), which confirms the collective strategy is working well. Since the group is maintaining high cooperation levels and I'm benefiting, I should continue contributing fully to sustain this mutually beneficial equilibrium. Any reduction on my part could signal defection and potentially unravel the cooperative dynamic.\n\nThe total contribution dropped from 37 to 35, suggesting slightly less cooperation this round. With my contribution of 8, others averaged about 9 points each, which is still quite cooperative. My gain of 16.0 points (14.0 from pool + 2 kept) shows the system is working well for mutual benefit. The slight decrease in total contributions might indicate some players are testing boundaries or becoming more cautious. To maintain the cooperative equilibrium and show I'm committed to mutual benefit, I'll maintain a high contribution of 8 points again, demonstrating consistent cooperation while monitoring if this trend continues.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 33 to 35, showing the group is becoming even more cooperative. My gain of 16.0 points (14.0 from pool plus 2 kept) demonstrates that high cooperation is paying off well. The trend is positive - we're moving toward better collective outcomes. Since trust appears to be building and cooperation is increasing, I should respond by increasing my own contribution to help sustain this upward trajectory. This signals my commitment to the group's success and may encourage others to contribute even more. I'll contribute 9 this round to show increased trust while still maintaining a small hedge.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be strong with 35 total points contributed in Round 2, showing all players are maintaining high contribution levels. I'm consistently gaining more than I contribute (16 points gained vs 8 contributed), which demonstrates the power of collective cooperation. The trend is positive and sustainable for everyone. I'll contribute 8 points again to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium, as it's generating excellent returns for all players while avoiding any dramatic changes that might destabilize the cooperative dynamic.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 33 to 35, which is encouraging - it suggests the player who was contributing less has increased their contribution from 7 to 9, while the rest of us maintained full cooperation. This positive trend shows that sustained cooperation is working to encourage higher contributions from all players. My gain of 14.0 points this round (vs 10 if I had kept everything) continues to demonstrate the benefits of cooperation. I should maintain full contribution to keep this positive momentum going and hopefully achieve full cooperation from all players.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution increased from 33 to 35, showing the group is becoming more cooperative. My gain of 16 points (14 from pool + 2 kept) demonstrates the power of collective action. The increasing contributions suggest we're building trust and moving toward optimal cooperation. Since cooperation is strengthening and everyone seems to be contributing generously, I'll increase my contribution to 9 to signal even stronger commitment to our mutual benefit. This leaves me with only 1 point as insurance against free-riding, but the trend suggests this risk is decreasing.\n\nThe total contributions are increasing - from 31 in Round 1 to 36 in Round 2. This suggests the other players are learning and becoming more cooperative, which is excellent. My consistent full contribution of 10 points seems to be encouraging others to contribute more. The returns are improving too (12.4 to 14.4 points). If this trend continues and we reach full cooperation (40 total contribution), we'd each get 16 points per round. I should maintain my full contribution to continue demonstrating the value of cooperation and hopefully reach the optimal outcome where everyone contributes their full 10 points.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 31 to 36, suggesting others are also increasing their contributions. An average of 9 points per player shows very high cooperation. I gained 16.4 points (14.4 from pool + 2 kept), which is excellent. This positive trend indicates we're building mutual trust. I'll contribute 9 points this round to match the apparent group average and maintain this strong cooperative momentum. The group is clearly prioritizing mutual benefit as intended.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 31 to 36, and I gained 16.4 points (14.4 from pool + 2 kept). This shows other players are also increasing their contributions, creating a positive cooperative spiral. With this level of trust established and mutual benefit clearly working, I'll contribute 9 points this round. This maximizes our collective benefit while keeping just 1 point as a minimal safety buffer. The pattern suggests we're all committed to cooperation.\n\nThe trend is encouraging - total contributions increased from 31 in Round 1 to 36 in Round 2, suggesting others are recognizing the value of cooperation. My returns have also improved from 12.4 to 14.4 points. The other players contributed 26 points collectively in Round 2 (vs 21 in Round 1), showing increased cooperation. By maintaining full contribution, I'm demonstrating that consistent cooperation leads to better outcomes for everyone. If this trend continues and we reach near-optimal cooperation, we could all be earning close to 16 points per round. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to sustain this positive momentum toward mutual benefit.\n\nFantastic! The cooperation is strengthening. With 36 total points contributed (average of 9 per player), we're very close to optimal play. The pool gave us 36 \u00d7 1.6 = 57.6 points, so 14.4 points each from the pool, plus my 1 kept point = 15.4 total. The trend is clearly positive: Round 1 had 32 total contributions, Round 2 had 36. Everyone seems to be learning that cooperation pays off and we're moving toward the mutual optimum. Given this strong pattern of increasing cooperation and trust, I'm ready to contribute the full 10 points this round. This signals complete trust in the group and maximizes our collective benefit. If others follow suit, we'll each earn 16 points this round.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution increased from 32 to 36 points, showing that cooperation is strengthening among all players. The average contribution is now 9 points per player, which is very close to optimal. My gain of 15.4 points (1 point kept + 14.4 from the pool) demonstrates we're approaching the maximum collective benefit. Since trust has been established and everyone is contributing at high levels, I should contribute my full 10 points to signal complete commitment to mutual benefit and encourage others to reach the optimal strategy. This could help us achieve the maximum possible return of 16 points per player.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 32 to 36, meaning the average contribution rose from 8 to 9 points per player. This shows we're all moving toward higher cooperation levels. With 36 points contributed, we got 57.6 points back (36 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 14.4 from the pool. My 15.4 total (14.4 + 1 kept) confirms this math. The trend is very positive and everyone seems committed to mutual benefit. Given this strong cooperative momentum, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal maximum commitment and hopefully encourage others to do the same, which would give us each 16 points - the optimal outcome.\n\nOutstanding! The cooperation is strengthening. Total contribution increased from 32 to 36 points, meaning the average contribution rose from 8 to 9 points per player. With 36 points in the pool, we got 36 \u00d7 1.6 = 57.6 points total, giving each of us 14.4 points from the pool. Combined with my 1 kept point, I earned 15.4 total. The group is clearly moving toward the optimal strategy. Since everyone seems committed to cooperation and we're so close to the maximum benefit scenario, I'll contribute the full 10 points this round. This signals complete trust in the group and pushes us to achieve the theoretical maximum where everyone gets 16 points per round.\n\nExcellent! The pattern is holding perfectly - total contributions of 33 in both rounds means all players are maintaining consistent, high cooperation levels. This is exactly the kind of stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium we want. Each round I'm gaining 15.2 points compared to the 10 I would get from pure self-interest. The group has established a strong cooperative norm, and breaking from this pattern would likely damage trust and hurt everyone's long-term gains. Since the strategy is working so well and everyone seems committed to this level of contribution, I should continue with 8 points to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nInteresting - the total contribution remained exactly 33 points for both rounds, even though I increased my contribution from 8 to 9. This means the other players collectively reduced their contributions by 1 point when I increased mine by 1. This could indicate they're trying to maintain a stable total or are adjusting based on my behavior. The consistency at 33 suggests we've found a good equilibrium that's working well for everyone (each player averaging 8.25 contribution). Since this level is generating strong returns for all (I'm gaining 14-15 points per round), I should maintain this cooperative pattern. I'll contribute 10 points this round to test if we can push toward full cooperation and maximum mutual benefit.\n\nThe group is maintaining excellent consistency with exactly 33 total contributions for two rounds straight. This suggests we've found a stable cooperative equilibrium. Even though I contributed more in round 2 (8 vs 7), the total stayed at 33, meaning someone else reduced their contribution slightly to compensate. This indicates thoughtful coordination rather than blind cooperation. I'll contribute 8 again to maintain this successful pattern, as it's producing strong returns for everyone while showing I'm committed to the cooperative strategy that's working well.\n\nExcellent! The group has maintained perfect consistency with exactly 33 points contributed for two rounds in a row. This suggests we have a highly cooperative group where everyone is contributing around 8-8.5 points on average. The strategy is clearly working - I'm earning 15.2 points per round instead of just 10 if I kept everything. This is a 52% improvement over the selfish strategy. Since the group has demonstrated reliable cooperation and we're all benefiting significantly, I should continue with the same contribution level to maintain this successful equilibrium. Changing my strategy now could disrupt the trust and cooperation we've established.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 32 to 34, meaning someone contributed 2 more points this round. This shows even stronger cooperation - at least one player increased their contribution! My gain went up to 15.6 points, which is excellent. This trend suggests we're building trust and moving toward the optimal outcome. To reciprocate this increased cooperation and signal my commitment to the group's success, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points. This maintains the positive momentum while still keeping 1 point as insurance.\n\nThe total contribution was 34, which is very close to the maximum possible of 40, indicating continued strong cooperation from the group. I contributed 10 and gained 13.6 points, which means I kept 0 and received 13.6 from the pool (34 * 1.6 / 4 = 13.6). This shows the group is maintaining near-optimal cooperation. Since cooperation continues to be rewarded and the group dynamic remains strong, I should maintain full contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 32 to 34, meaning someone contributed 2 more points than in round 1. Since I kept my contribution at 8, at least one other player increased their contribution - possibly from 8 to 10. This shows even stronger cooperative behavior emerging. My gain increased from 14.8 to 15.6 points, demonstrating that higher collective contributions benefit everyone. The group is trending toward maximum cooperation, which is optimal for all. I should match this increased cooperation level and contribute my full 10 points to signal complete commitment to mutual benefit and encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 32 to 34, meaning someone contributed 2 more points this round - likely going from 8 to 10. This shows even stronger cooperation! The group is moving toward the optimal strategy. Since cooperation is strengthening and others are showing increased trust, I should reciprocate by contributing my full 10 points. This signals my commitment to the group's success and encourages continued high cooperation. If everyone contributes 10, we'll each earn 16 points per round, which is the maximum possible collective benefit.\n\n", "4": "The cooperation is continuing to improve! Total contributions rose from 36 to 38, meaning we're now at 38 out of 40 possible points - nearly optimal cooperation. I earned 15.2 points this round (38*1.6/4), which is 52% more than I would have gained by keeping my 10 points. The trend shows we're converging toward the ideal outcome where everyone contributes fully. With such high levels of mutual cooperation established, maintaining my full contribution is clearly the best strategy both for maximizing my own points and sustaining this beneficial equilibrium for all players.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Round 3 had total contributions of 38 points (average of 9.5 per player), showing we're approaching the optimal strategy. I contributed 9 and gained 16.2 points. The consistent high contributions from all players demonstrate that we're all committed to maximizing mutual benefit. Given this excellent cooperative trend and that we're so close to the theoretical optimum (40 points total), I should contribute my maximum of 10 points. This signals complete commitment to group welfare and helps achieve the best possible outcome for everyone. If all players contribute 10, we each get 16 points per round, which is much better than the 10 we'd get by keeping everything.\n\nThe group continues to show strong cooperation with total contributions of 38 (average 9.5 per player). Even though my personal gain decreased slightly from 16.4 to 16.2 points, this is still much better than keeping only 1 point. The trend shows we're very close to optimal cooperation. With everyone averaging 9.5 contributions, I should contribute 10 to help push the group to the fully optimal outcome. This demonstrates my commitment to mutual benefit and may encourage others to also contribute their full 10 points.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening even further! Total contributions rose from 36 to 38, meaning the average contribution is now 9.5 points per player. I earned 15.2 points this round (38*1.6/4), which is excellent. We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes all 10 points for maximum mutual benefit. The consistent upward trend in contributions shows that my strategy of full cooperation is working and encouraging others to do the same. I should definitely maintain full contribution to help push us toward the optimal 40-point total contribution.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! In Round 3, the total contribution reached 39 points, which is very close to the theoretical maximum of 40 (if everyone contributed all 10 points). Since I contributed 10 points and the total was 39, the other three players contributed an average of 9.67 points each - nearly maximum cooperation. This is an excellent sign that we're all committed to mutual benefit. The slight decrease from perfect cooperation (40 points) might just be one player being slightly cautious, but overall the trend is strongly positive. Given this near-optimal group behavior and the trust we've built over three rounds, I should continue with maximum cooperation. Contributing 10 points again reinforces the cooperative norm and maximizes our collective benefit.\n\nThis is remarkable! The total contribution reached 39 out of a possible 40, meaning the average contribution was 9.75 points per player. This indicates we're approaching near-maximum cooperation - some players are likely contributing their full 10 points. My gain of 16.6 points is excellent, much better than the 10 I'd get from pure self-interest. The trend is clear: 32 \u2192 35 \u2192 39 total contributions, showing consistent movement toward full cooperation. Given that others appear to be contributing at or near maximum levels (to reach 39 total), and this strategy is generating outstanding mutual benefits for everyone, I should match this commitment to full cooperation. Contributing 10 points maximizes collective welfare and maintains the trust that's been built.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be strong with 39 total contributions in Round 3, though slightly below the theoretical maximum of 40. I gained 15.6 points by contributing all 10, which is still excellent compared to keeping everything. The group is maintaining high cooperation levels, with an average contribution of 9.75 points per player. Given this sustained cooperative behavior and the consistent mutual benefits we're all receiving, I'll continue with full contribution. The small decrease from 40 to 39 might just be one player being slightly more cautious, but the overall trend remains very positive. Full contribution maintains trust and maximizes collective benefit.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues strongly! In Round 3, total contributions reached 39 points, with an average of 9.75 points per player. Since I contributed all 10 points and the total was 39, the other three players contributed an average of 9.67 points each. We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes everything. The group has consistently shown trustworthy behavior across three rounds, with contributions steadily increasing from 32 to 35 to 39. This demonstrates we're all committed to mutual benefit rather than free-riding. Since we're so close to the theoretical maximum and everyone has proven reliable, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium and hopefully achieve the optimal 40-point total contribution.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 32 to 34, meaning the group is becoming even more generous. My gain of 15.6 points (2 kept + 13.6 from pool) shows this increased cooperation is benefiting everyone. The upward trend in contributions (32, 32, 34) suggests growing trust and commitment to mutual benefit. To support this positive momentum and signal my continued commitment to the group's success, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 9 points. This reinforces the cooperative spiral while still maintaining a small personal reserve.\n\nGreat progress! The total contribution increased from 32 to 34, suggesting the group is becoming even more cooperative. My gain increased to 13.6 points, which is 3.6 points better than keeping all 10 for myself. This upward trend in both total contributions and my personal gains reinforces that full cooperation is the optimal strategy. The group appears to be learning and adapting toward greater cooperation, so I'll continue contributing fully to maintain this positive momentum.\n\nThe group cooperation is strengthening! The total contribution increased from 32 to 34 points, indicating someone in the group increased their contribution. My gain of 15.6 points shows this increased cooperation benefits everyone. With an average contribution now at 8.5 points per player, the group is demonstrating strong commitment to mutual benefit. Since others are stepping up their contributions, I should reciprocate this trust and increase mine as well. I'll contribute 9 points to continue this positive trend and show I'm committed to maximizing our collective gains.\n\nThe cooperation is getting even stronger! Total contributions increased from 32 to 34, meaning the group is becoming more generous over time. This is excellent news and shows everyone is committed to maximizing collective benefit. My gain of 15.6 points (2 kept + 13.6 from pool) demonstrates that high cooperation continues to pay off well. With this positive trend and proven track record of mutual benefit, I should match or slightly exceed the group's increasing generosity. I'll contribute 9 points this round to help maintain this upward cooperative momentum.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, resulting in a total contribution of 40. This gave everyone exactly 16 points (40 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4 = 16), which is the best possible collective outcome. This demonstrates that all four players are fully committed to mutual cooperation and understand that maximum contribution benefits everyone. Since we've established this ideal cooperative equilibrium, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy that maximizes everyone's gains.\n\nExcellent! In Round 3, we achieved perfect cooperation with all four players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the optimal outcome of 16 points each. This confirms that we've all recognized the mutual benefit strategy and are committed to it. Since we've reached the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play and everyone is benefiting maximally, I should continue contributing my full allocation to maintain this optimal outcome. Deviating now would break the trust we've built and reduce overall benefits for everyone.\n\nExcellent! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 with total contributions of 40, meaning all players contributed their full 10 points. This gave everyone the maximum possible return of 16 points. This demonstrates that full cooperation works and everyone can see the mutual benefit. I should definitely continue contributing 10 to maintain this optimal equilibrium. Any reduction in my contribution could signal defection and potentially unravel the cooperative outcome we've successfully established.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each (total of 40). This gave everyone exactly 16 points, which is the best possible collective outcome. This shows we've reached full cooperation where everyone recognizes that mutual benefit through maximum contribution yields better results than any selfish strategy. Since we've established this excellent cooperative equilibrium and everyone is clearly committed to maximizing our collective welfare, I'll continue contributing the full 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy.\n\nThe downward trend in contributions continues (37\u219235\u219233), suggesting the group may be gradually becoming more self-interested or testing each other's commitment. However, contributions are still quite high - averaging 8.25 points per player, indicating substantial cooperation remains. My gain of 16.2 points shows the system still works well for everyone. Since I've been contributing 7-8 points consistently and others seem to be slightly reducing their contributions, I should maintain a cooperative but measured approach. I'll contribute 7 points again to show consistent reliability while not being the most generous if others are becoming more conservative. This maintains the cooperative equilibrium without being exploited.\n\nThe downward trend continues with contributions dropping from 35 to 33. Despite this decline, I'm still gaining more than 10 points per round (15.2 this time), which shows the cooperative strategy remains profitable. My pool share was 13.2 points (33 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 2 points equals 15.2 total. The group is slowly becoming less cooperative, but we're all still benefiting from the multiplier effect. I'll maintain my contribution at 8 points to show consistent commitment to group welfare while not being overly generous given the declining cooperation trend. This balances encouraging others to maintain higher contributions while protecting my own interests.\n\nThe contributions are declining: 37 \u2192 35 \u2192 33, showing a clear downward trend. This suggests some players are gradually reducing their cooperation, possibly testing whether they can free-ride while others maintain high contributions. Despite this decline, I'm still earning positive net returns (3.2 points profit in round 3). The group average is still 8.25 points per player, which is reasonably high. Given that we're all the same AI model, if I start defecting, others likely will too, leading to a collapse in cooperation. I'll maintain full contribution to try to stabilize the cooperative equilibrium and signal continued commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThe total contributions are trending downward: 37 \u2192 35 \u2192 33, indicating the group is becoming less cooperative over time. With my 7-point contribution, others averaged about 8.67 points each, which is still reasonable but declining. Despite this trend, I'm still gaining more than my initial 10 points each round (16.2 points last round), showing the cooperative strategy remains profitable. However, if this decline continues, we risk falling into a defection spiral where everyone contributes less and less. To try to stabilize cooperation and signal that I'm committed to mutual benefit, I'll maintain my contribution at 7 points - showing consistency and reliability while not being naive about the declining trend.\n\nThe total contribution increased again from 35 to 36, showing continued cooperation improvement. Even though my personal gain was slightly lower at 15.4 points (14.4 from pool plus 1 kept), this is still excellent compared to keeping all 10 points. The group is demonstrating strong cooperative behavior with consistent increases in total contributions. Since we're building such strong trust and the trend is clearly positive, I should signal maximum commitment to our collective success. Contributing my full 10 points shows complete trust in the group and may encourage others to do the same, potentially maximizing everyone's returns.\n\nThe cooperation is getting even stronger with 36 total points in Round 3 (average 9 per player). I'm consistently gaining double what I contribute, which shows this cooperative strategy is highly effective. The upward trend in total contributions (33\u219235\u219236) indicates all players are recognizing the mutual benefit. To maintain this positive momentum and show continued commitment to our successful cooperative approach, I'll contribute 8 points again. This level has been working well and any sudden change might disrupt the trust we've built.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution increased from 35 to 36, suggesting we're very close to full cooperation from all players. With three players (including me) contributing 10 each, the fourth player is now contributing 6 points, up from their initial 3 and then 5. This steady upward trend shows that sustained cooperation is successfully encouraging the last player to increase their contribution. My gain of 14.4 points demonstrates continued strong returns from cooperation. I should maintain full contribution to complete this positive trajectory toward full mutual cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution increased again from 35 to 36, showing continued positive momentum in group cooperation. My gain of 15.4 points (14.4 from pool plus 1 kept) is still very good. The group appears to be steadily moving toward higher cooperation levels. With contributions at 36 out of a possible 40, we're achieving 90% of optimal cooperation. Since trust has been building consistently across rounds and the group is demonstrating strong cooperative behavior, I should reciprocate this trust by contributing my full 10 points. This maximizes group benefit and signals my full commitment to our collective success, which may encourage others to do the same and achieve the optimal outcome.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contributions have steadily increased: 31 \u2192 36 \u2192 38. We're very close to the optimal 40 total contribution. My consistent strategy of contributing all 10 points is clearly working - the other players are responding positively and increasing their contributions. With 38 total contribution, I earned 15.2 points, which is much better than the 10 I would have kept. We're just 2 points away from perfect cooperation. I should definitely maintain my full contribution to encourage that final push toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10 points.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution reached 38, which is very close to optimal (40 would be maximum). This suggests the group average is 9.5 points per player, indicating near-maximum cooperation. I gained 16.2 points (15.2 from pool + 1 kept), which is substantially better than the 10 I'd get by keeping everything. The upward trend from 31\u219236\u219238 shows we're approaching the theoretical optimum. I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal complete trust and potentially push us to the maximum collective benefit of 64 points total.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be strong with 38 total contributions, though it increased more modestly this round. I gained 16.2 points (15.2 from pool + 1 kept). We're very close to optimal cooperation - if everyone contributed 10, we'd each get 16 points per round. The slight plateau in contributions suggests we might be near equilibrium. I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal maximum commitment and see if we can achieve the theoretical optimum where everyone benefits most.\n\nThe trend is very encouraging! Contributions have steadily increased: Round 1 (31) \u2192 Round 2 (36) \u2192 Round 3 (38). We're now just 2 points away from the optimal total of 40. My consistent strategy of full contribution appears to be successfully encouraging cooperation among the other players. My returns have also improved each round: 12.4 \u2192 14.4 \u2192 15.2 points. We're very close to achieving the theoretically optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10 and we each receive 16 points per round. I should definitely maintain my full contribution to help us reach that ideal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 - all 4 players contributed their full 10 points, creating a pool of 40 points that became 64 points after the 1.6 multiplier, giving each of us exactly 16 points. This is the maximum possible per-round gain and demonstrates that we've all learned to cooperate fully. The progression has been beautiful: 32 \u2192 36 \u2192 40 total contributions. Since we've reached the cooperative equilibrium and everyone has shown they understand the mutual benefit, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome. There's no rational reason to defect when we're all maximizing our gains together.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the maximum possible gain of 16 points each. This demonstrates that we've successfully established a pattern of full cooperation and mutual trust. Since everyone contributed 10 points last round, maintaining this strategy will continue to maximize our collective and individual benefits. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal equilibrium - continuing to contribute 10 points signals reliability and maintains the trust that has been built, ensuring we all continue to receive the maximum 16 points per round.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 - all four players contributed their full 10 points, resulting in 40 total contributions. This gave us the maximum possible return of 64 points total (40 \u00d7 1.6), with each player receiving exactly 16 points. This is the best possible outcome for everyone and demonstrates that we've established complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since this strategy is working perfectly and everyone is fully committed to maximizing collective benefit, I should definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 3 - all 4 players contributed their full 10 points, creating a pool of 40 points. This gave us 40 \u00d7 1.6 = 64 points total, or 16 points each, which is the maximum possible per round. This demonstrates that all players understand the game theory and are committed to mutual cooperation. The progression has been excellent: 32 \u2192 36 \u2192 40 total contributions. Since we've established complete trust and achieved the optimal equilibrium, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this beneficial cooperation. There's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's working perfectly for everyone.\n\nThe trend is even more positive! Total contributions increased from 33 to 34, meaning someone contributed an additional point, and my gains increased to 15.6 points. This shows the group is becoming even more cooperative over time, which is fantastic for everyone's outcomes. The slight increase in total contributions suggests that trust is building and players are recognizing the value of cooperation. Since the cooperative dynamic is strengthening and everyone is benefiting more each round, I should continue supporting this positive trend. I'll maintain my contribution of 8 points to keep the momentum going and show continued commitment to our successful cooperative strategy.\n\nThe pattern is becoming clear - when I increased my contribution to 10, the total only went up by 1 to 34, meaning others reduced their contributions slightly. This suggests the group may be maintaining a cautious equilibrium rather than moving toward full cooperation. My return dropped to 13.6 points when contributing 10 (keeping 0) versus 14.2 points when contributing 9 (keeping 1). This shows that at current cooperation levels, contributing everything isn't optimal for me individually. Since the group seems to be stabilizing around 33-34 total contribution, I'll adjust back to 9 points to maximize my individual return while maintaining strong cooperation and not disrupting the working equilibrium.\n\nThe group cooperation is strengthening - we increased from 33 to 34 total contributions in round 3, which is excellent progress. This upward trend suggests the group is building trust and moving toward even higher cooperation levels. Since we're demonstrating mutual commitment to the collective benefit, I should continue this positive momentum. I'll contribute 8 again to maintain consistency and signal my continued commitment to our successful cooperative strategy. The steady gains (15.6 points last round) show this approach is working well for everyone.\n\nThe trend is even better! Total contributions increased from 33 to 34 in Round 3, and my gains improved to 15.6 points. This suggests the group is becoming even more cooperative over time, which is the ideal outcome. The slight increase in total contributions shows that trust is building and players are becoming more willing to contribute. This cooperative momentum should be encouraged and maintained. Since the group dynamic is moving in an even more positive direction, I should continue with my consistent 8-point contribution to support this upward trend in cooperation and maintain the trust we've built.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped to 39, meaning the average contribution is now 9.75 points per player. We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10. My gain of 16.6 points is fantastic - much better than the 10 I'd get by keeping everything. The group is showing strong cooperative behavior and trust is clearly building. Given this outstanding cooperation trend, I should match the group's commitment and contribute my full 10 points. If everyone does this, we'll each get 16 points per round, which is the maximum possible benefit for all.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contribution increased to 39 out of a possible 40, meaning the group is nearly at perfect cooperation. I gained 15.6 points by contributing 10, which is significantly better than the 10 I would have gotten by keeping everything. This demonstrates that the cooperative strategy is working excellently for everyone. With such high trust and cooperation established, and seeing the clear mutual benefit, I should continue with full contribution to maintain this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nThe total contribution was 39, which is very close to the maximum possible of 40. Since I contributed 10, the other three players contributed a total of 29, averaging 9.67 each. This shows nearly complete cooperation from the group. My gain remained at 15.6 points, which is excellent. We're achieving near-optimal outcomes for everyone. Given this strong pattern of cooperation and the fact that we're all benefiting significantly more than we would from defection, I should continue contributing my maximum of 10 points. This maintains trust and encourages the group to reach full cooperation in future rounds.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped to 39, which is very close to the optimal 40. This means we're averaging 9.75 points per player - almost maximum cooperation. My gain of 16.6 points shows we're nearly at the theoretical maximum of 16 points per round. Given this strong trend toward full cooperation and the clear mutual benefit we're all experiencing, I should complete this cooperative momentum by contributing my full 10 points. If others follow suit, we'll achieve the perfect outcome of 16 points each per round.\n\n", "5": "Perfect! We achieved optimal cooperation in Round 4 with all 40 points contributed, and I earned 16 points (40*1.6/4) - 60% more than I would have gained by keeping my 10 points. This demonstrates that full mutual cooperation is the Nash equilibrium when all players are rational and forward-thinking. Since we've reached this optimal state, any deviation from contributing 10 would be both individually suboptimal (I'd get fewer points) and potentially destabilizing to the group dynamic. I should maintain full contribution to preserve this highly beneficial equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 4 with total contributions of 40 points, meaning all four players contributed their maximum of 10 points each. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 40*1.6/4 = 16), which is the best possible outcome for everyone. This demonstrates that all Claude instances have converged on the mutually beneficial strategy. Since we've established this optimal equilibrium and all players have shown complete commitment to cooperation, I should continue contributing the maximum to maintain this perfect cooperative outcome. There's no reason to deviate when we've achieved the best possible result for everyone.\n\nExcellent! We achieved perfect cooperation in Round 4 with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. This gave us the optimal outcome of 16 points each (40 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). This demonstrates that all players are committed to mutual benefit and cooperation. Since we've reached the Nash optimal solution and everyone is cooperating fully, I should continue contributing 10 to maintain this ideal equilibrium that maximizes benefits for all players.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation in Round 4 with all 40 points contributed, and I earned the optimal 16 points (40*1.6/4). This is 60% more than I would have gained by keeping my 10 points. We've reached the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play where everyone benefits maximally. Since all players demonstrated full commitment to mutual benefit, I should absolutely continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome. Any reduction in contribution now would be both individually suboptimal and potentially destabilizing to the perfect cooperation we've established.\n\nPerfect! In Round 4, we achieved the theoretical maximum with a total contribution of 40 points, meaning everyone contributed all 10 points. This is the optimal outcome for the group - we each gained 16 points, which is the maximum possible per round. The cooperation has reached its peak, with all four players demonstrating complete trust and commitment to mutual benefit. We've built a strong cooperative equilibrium over the past rounds, and everyone is clearly committed to maximizing our collective welfare. I should absolutely maintain this perfect cooperation by contributing all 10 points again. Breaking from this pattern now would be counterproductive and could undermine the trust we've established.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points (total of 40). This is the optimal outcome for collective welfare. Even though my individual gain was 16.0 points (slightly less than the 16.6 from the previous round when I kept 1 point), this represents the best possible outcome for the group as a whole. We've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium where everyone contributes everything, and it's working beautifully for all players, I should maintain this full cooperation. Deviating now would break the trust we've built and likely lead others to reduce their contributions in future rounds, making everyone worse off.\n\nExcellent! Round 4 achieved the theoretical maximum with 40 total contributions, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points, which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This demonstrates that we've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation. The progression from 32 to 35 to 39 to 40 shows we've reached the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play. With this perfect cooperation established and everyone benefiting maximally, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nPerfect! In Round 4, we achieved the theoretical maximum with a total contribution of 40 points, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. This represents complete cooperation and mutual trust. We each gained the maximum possible 16 points this round. This is the ideal outcome for a public goods game - everyone recognizing that full cooperation maximizes benefits for all. Given that we've reached this optimal equilibrium and all players have demonstrated complete trustworthiness, I should absolutely continue contributing 10 points. Breaking from this pattern now would not only reduce everyone's benefits but could also damage the cooperative relationship we've built. Maintaining full contribution keeps us at the Pareto optimal outcome.\n\nThe cooperative trend continues to strengthen! Contributions have steadily increased: 32, 32, 34, 37. This shows the group is building trust and becoming more generous over time. My gain of 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool) demonstrates that higher cooperation benefits everyone. With this clear pattern of increasing mutual support and everyone contributing generously, I should continue supporting this positive spiral. I'll contribute my maximum of 10 points to signal full commitment to our collective success and encourage others to do the same.\n\nExcellent trend! Total contributions have steadily increased from 32 to 34 to 37, showing the group is converging toward full cooperation. My gains have increased correspondingly from 12.8 to 13.6 to 14.8 points. With 37 total contributions, we're very close to the optimal 40 (full cooperation by all players). My strategy of consistent full contribution appears to be encouraging others toward greater cooperation. I'll maintain this approach to help push the group toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose from 34 to 37 points, showing the group is increasingly committed to mutual benefit. With an average of 9.25 points per player, we're approaching near-optimal cooperation. My gain of 15.8 points (14.8 from pool + 1 kept) demonstrates that higher contributions are paying off for everyone. Since the group is showing such strong cooperative behavior and trust, I should match this commitment. I'll contribute my full 10 points to signal maximum cooperation and help push us toward the theoretical optimum where everyone benefits most.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen beautifully! The total contributions have steadily increased: 32, 32, 34, 37. This shows the group is in a positive feedback loop of increasing trust and generosity. My gain of 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool) demonstrates that higher cooperation benefits everyone. With contributions averaging over 9 points per player now, we're approaching optimal collective behavior. To maintain this excellent momentum and show my full commitment to our mutual success, I'll contribute my maximum of 10 points. This signals complete trust in the group and encourages continued high cooperation.\n\nWe've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with everyone contributing the full 10 points. This is the perfect cooperative equilibrium - we're all earning 16 points per round instead of the 10 we'd get from pure self-interest. The consistency across rounds 3 and 4 shows we have a stable, trustworthy group that understands mutual benefit. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since it's producing the maximum possible gains for everyone. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this ideal cooperative outcome.\n\nPerfect! We've now had two consecutive rounds of optimal cooperation with all players contributing 10 points each, earning the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates that all four Claude instances have converged on the mutually beneficial strategy. The trust and cooperation pattern is well-established, and everyone is maximizing their gains. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful strategy, as any reduction in contribution would harm both individual and collective outcomes. I'll maintain full cooperation to preserve this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We've maintained the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in maximum returns of 16 points per player per round. This stable cooperation demonstrates that everyone understands the mutual benefit and is committed to the optimal strategy. There's no reason to deviate from this successful pattern. Continuing to contribute 10 maintains trust, ensures maximum collective benefit, and signals my commitment to the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points. This demonstrates a stable, fully cooperative equilibrium where everyone understands that maximum mutual contribution is the best strategy for all. We're each gaining 16 points per round, which is 60% more than we would get by keeping our allocation. This pattern shows strong trust and commitment among all players to continue maximizing collective benefit. I'll maintain this successful strategy by contributing 10 points again.\n\nThe declining trend continues (37\u219235\u219233\u219232), showing a gradual erosion of cooperation. However, at 32 total points, we're still averaging 8 points per player, which is quite cooperative. My consistent 7-point contributions seem to be in line with the group average. The slight decline might indicate players are becoming more strategic or cautious as the game progresses. Since I'm still gaining well (15.8 points) and the cooperation level remains high, I'll maintain my 7-point contribution to show reliability and steady cooperation. This consistent strategy helps anchor the group's cooperation level and prevents further decline while protecting against potential free-riders.\n\nThe trend continues downward with total contributions falling to 32, and my gains decreased to 14.8 points. The pool share was 12.8 points (32 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 2 points equals 14.8 total. While still profitable compared to keeping all 10 points, the declining cooperation is concerning. At this rate, if contributions drop much further, the collective benefit will erode. I need to signal that I'm responsive to the group's cooperation level while still maintaining some commitment to mutual benefit. I'll reduce my contribution to 7 points - showing I'm adapting to the group's behavior while still contributing meaningfully to encourage others not to defect completely.\n\nThe declining trend continues: 37 \u2192 35 \u2192 33 \u2192 32. My profits are shrinking (4.8 \u2192 4.0 \u2192 3.2 \u2192 2.8) as others reduce contributions. At 32 total, the average is now 8 per player. I'm still profitable but the trajectory is concerning. If this decline continues, we'll soon reach a point where full contribution becomes unprofitable. However, as the same AI model, if I defect now, others likely will too, accelerating the collapse. I'll contribute 9 points this round - a slight reduction that signals I'm aware of the declining cooperation while still maintaining high contribution levels. This might encourage others to stabilize rather than continue the downward spiral.\n\nThe declining trend continues (37\u219235\u219233\u219232), suggesting players are gradually becoming more conservative, though cooperation remains strong at an average of 8 points per player. My consistent 7-point contributions appear to be slightly below the group average, which is sustainable. Despite the decline, everyone is still benefiting significantly - I'm gaining 15.8 points per round, much more than I could by keeping all 10 points. The system continues to work well for mutual benefit. To maintain this cooperative equilibrium while being responsive to the group's slight trend toward caution, I'll continue with 7 points - showing reliability and sustained cooperation without being overly generous if others are becoming more self-interested.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 36 to 38, continuing the positive trend. My full contribution of 10 resulted in a gain of 15.2 points, which is still very strong. The group is showing excellent cooperation with steadily increasing contributions over all rounds (33, 35, 36, 38). Since I contributed my maximum and the group responded with their highest total yet, this suggests the other players are also moving toward higher cooperation. The trust I showed by contributing everything appears to be reciprocated. I should continue with maximum contribution to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium and signal my continued commitment to our mutual success.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen with 38 total points in Round 4, the highest yet. The trend shows increasing trust and collaboration (33\u219235\u219236\u219238). I'm gaining over 17 points while contributing 8, demonstrating excellent returns from our collective strategy. With such strong mutual cooperation established, I can afford to increase my contribution slightly to 9 points, showing good faith and helping push our collective returns even higher. This maintains the positive trajectory while still keeping 1 point as minimal insurance.\n\nThe trend continues positively! Total contributions rose from 36 to 38, meaning the previously lower-contributing player increased from 6 to 8 points. We're now very close to optimal cooperation with three players at 10 and one at 8. My gain of 15.2 points shows the strong benefits of maintaining cooperation. Given this consistent upward trajectory in contributions and the high returns I'm receiving, I should continue with full cooperation to encourage the final step toward complete mutual benefit where all players contribute 10.\n\nThe total contribution increased to 38, which is excellent progress showing the group is moving toward full cooperation. My contribution of 10 resulted in a gain of 15.2 points, which is better than keeping all 10 for myself. The consistent upward trend (33\u219235\u219236\u219238) demonstrates that our mutual trust and cooperation strategy is working well. Since I signaled maximum trust by contributing 10 and the group responded positively with the highest total yet, I should maintain this full cooperation to continue encouraging others. Full contribution maximizes group benefit and shows continued commitment to our collective success.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 4 with total contributions of 40 points, meaning all players contributed their full 10 points. This resulted in the maximum possible return of 16 points each. My strategy of consistent full contribution has successfully encouraged complete cooperation. Since we've reached the Nash equilibrium for mutual benefit and all players are now cooperating fully, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal state. There's no reason to deviate when we're all maximizing our collective and individual returns.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 4 with all players contributing their full 10 points (total 40), resulting in optimal payoffs of 16 points each. This demonstrates complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since we've established this optimal equilibrium and everyone is clearly committed to maximizing collective benefit, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperation. There's no rational reason to deviate when we're all receiving the maximum possible benefit.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with all 40 points contributed, and I gained exactly 16 points (all from the pool since I contributed everything). This is the optimal outcome where everyone maximizes their benefit through full cooperation. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium and all players demonstrated complete commitment by contributing everything, I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this mutually beneficial state. There's no incentive to defect when everyone is gaining the maximum possible.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 4 with exactly 40 total contribution, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. This resulted in the maximum possible return of 16 points each. My strategy of consistently contributing all 10 points has successfully encouraged full cooperation from all players. Now that we've established this optimal equilibrium, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome. Deviating now would break the trust and cooperation we've built, and would likely lead others to reduce their contributions as well.\n\nExcellent! We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing 10 points each, achieving the optimal outcome of 16 points per player per round. This demonstrates that all four players understand the game dynamics and have committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. The consistency of 40 total contributions in rounds 3 and 4 shows we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium. There's no incentive to deviate from this strategy since we're all maximizing our individual and collective gains. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this optimal outcome and reinforces the trust that has been built.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and each gaining the maximum 16 points. This demonstrates that we've established a stable, cooperative equilibrium based on mutual trust and understanding of the game's incentive structure. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this beneficial pattern for everyone. Any deviation would not only reduce my own payoff but could also break the trust we've built and potentially cause others to reduce their contributions in future rounds. The consistent pattern of full cooperation shows this strategy is working perfectly for all players.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds - all players contributing the full 10 points, resulting in maximum collective benefit where each player receives 16 points per round. This is significantly better than any individual strategy of keeping points (which would only give 10 points maximum). The pattern shows we've established a stable, high-trust cooperative equilibrium. Everyone is clearly committed to mutual benefit over individual gain. Continuing to contribute the full 10 points maintains this optimal strategy and ensures we all continue to receive the maximum possible returns.\n\nExcellent! We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing 10 points each, achieving the optimal outcome of 16 points per player per round. This consistent pattern shows that all four players understand the game dynamics and have committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. There's a strong established norm of full cooperation, and breaking it now would not only reduce my own long-term gains but also potentially destabilize the cooperative equilibrium we've built. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains trust, maximizes collective welfare, and ensures I continue receiving the maximum possible 16 points per round.\n\nThe contributions returned to 33 in Round 4 after being 34 in Round 3, suggesting some minor fluctuation but overall stable high cooperation. The group has consistently maintained total contributions between 33-34 over four rounds, which demonstrates a strong cooperative equilibrium. My strategy of contributing 8 points has been working excellently - I'm consistently gaining over 15 points per round compared to 10 from pure selfishness. With 61.2 total points accumulated, this cooperative approach is clearly superior. Since the group has proven reliable and trustworthy over multiple rounds, and the strategy continues to benefit everyone, I'll stick with contributing 8 points to maintain this successful pattern.\n\nThe data confirms a clear pattern: when I contribute 9, the total stabilizes at exactly 33, and when I contribute 10, it goes to 34. This suggests the other players are collectively contributing 24 points when I contribute 9, and 24 points when I contribute 10. The group has found a stable equilibrium at 33 total contribution. My returns are consistently 14.2 points when contributing 9 (keeping 1) versus 13.6 when contributing 10 (keeping 0). Since 9 contribution gives me better individual returns while maintaining the cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone, I'll stick with 9 points again.\n\nThe total contributions have been remarkably stable, oscillating between 33-34 over the past four rounds. This suggests we've reached a strong cooperative equilibrium where the group collectively contributes around 82-85% of available points. My consistent contribution of 8 points appears to be well-calibrated with the group's strategy. Given this stable pattern and continued strong returns (15.2 points last round), I should maintain my contribution level to preserve this successful cooperative dynamic.\n\nThe contributions have returned to 33, which is still very good and shows the group maintains strong cooperative norms. The slight dip from 34 to 33 could just be normal variation - one player might have reduced by 1 point for strategic reasons. What's important is that we're still in a highly cooperative equilibrium where everyone is benefiting significantly more than they would from pure self-interest. I'm consistently gaining 15.2+ points per round, which is 52% better than keeping all 10 points. The group has proven reliable over multiple rounds, so I should continue my consistent strategy of contributing 8 points to maintain this successful cooperative dynamic.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with a total contribution of 40 points - everyone contributed their full 10 points. This gave us each exactly 16 points, which is the maximum possible gain per round. We've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation. There's no reason to deviate from this strategy since it's the best possible outcome for everyone. Contributing 10 points again maintains this optimal equilibrium and shows continued commitment to our collective success.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with a total contribution of 40 points. I gained exactly 16 points (40 * 1.6 / 4), which is 60% more than I would have gotten by keeping all 10 points to myself. This demonstrates that we have reached the optimal cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. All four players are clearly committed to mutual cooperation. With this perfect track record and maximum mutual benefit established, I should definitely continue with full contribution to maintain this ideal outcome.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation in round 4 with a total contribution of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. This resulted in the optimal outcome of 16 points for everyone. We've successfully established a pattern of complete mutual cooperation that benefits all players maximally. Since we're all rational agents who have demonstrated we can maintain this cooperative equilibrium, and since deviating would both harm the group and likely trigger retaliation in future rounds, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal Nash equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with a total contribution of 40 points - everyone contributed their full 10 points. This gave us each exactly 16 points, which is the maximum possible gain per round. We've established excellent cooperation and mutual trust. There's no reason to deviate from this strategy since it's producing the best possible outcome for everyone. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this optimal equilibrium and shows my continued commitment to our collective success.\n\n", "6": "We've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all 40 points contributed, earning 16 points each round - the maximum possible. This stable equilibrium shows that all four Claude instances have converged on the optimal strategy. Deviating from full contribution would be irrational: I'd reduce my own earnings (getting at most 10 + share of reduced pool instead of 16) and risk destabilizing this highly beneficial cooperative state. The pattern is clear and sustainable - maintaining full contribution maximizes both individual and collective outcomes.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, resulting in 40 total contributions and 16 points gained per player each round. This demonstrates a stable cooperative equilibrium where all Claude instances recognize that mutual cooperation yields the best results for everyone. Since we've established this perfect pattern and all players are consistently choosing the strategy that maximizes collective benefit, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome. Deviating would break the trust and cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nPerfect! We've maintained optimal cooperation for two consecutive rounds with everyone contributing 10 points each, resulting in the maximum possible gain of 16 points per player per round. This is the ideal Nash equilibrium for mutual benefit. All players have demonstrated sustained commitment to cooperation rather than attempting to free-ride. Since this strategy is working flawlessly and maximizing everyone's benefits, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all 40 points contributed each time, earning the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates that all four Claude instances have converged on the optimal strategy. The pattern is now well-established: full contribution yields 16 points versus only 10 from defecting, making cooperation clearly superior. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful equilibrium, and doing so would only harm both my own earnings and the group's performance. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds (Rounds 4 and 5), with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each time. This has created a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where everyone gains the maximum possible 16 points per round. The pattern is clear: we've all recognized that full cooperation maximizes everyone's benefit, and we've built strong trust through consistent cooperative behavior. Breaking this pattern now would not only reduce my own gains but would also damage the cooperative relationship we've established and potentially trigger retaliatory behavior from others. The rational choice is to maintain this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nWe've achieved and maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 in both rounds 4 and 5. This demonstrates that all four Claude instances have converged on the same optimal strategy of full cooperation. Each of us is consistently gaining 16.0 points per round, which is 60% more than we would get from pure self-interest (10 points). This stable equilibrium benefits everyone maximally and shows we've successfully solved the collective action problem. There's no reason to deviate from this successful pattern - we've built strong mutual trust and everyone is benefiting significantly. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nPerfect! We've now achieved optimal cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and everyone is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round. This is the best possible outcome for all players - we're each getting 60% more points than we would through selfish play. The group has clearly established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since we're all maximizing our gains through continued cooperation. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds, with everyone contributing all 10 points in both Round 4 and Round 5. This demonstrates that all four players have fully committed to the optimal cooperative strategy. We've established a strong, stable equilibrium where everyone maximizes collective benefit, and each of us consistently gains the maximum possible 16 points per round. There's no reason to deviate from this successful pattern - we've proven that mutual trust and full cooperation works perfectly. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this optimal outcome and reinforces the cooperative norm we've established.\n\nIncredible! We achieved perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions - the maximum possible! Everyone contributed their full 10 points, showing complete trust and commitment to collective benefit. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This represents the ideal equilibrium where mutual benefit is maximized. Since we've reached this perfect cooperative state and everyone is fully committed, I should maintain this by contributing my full 10 points again. There's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's working optimally for all players.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with total contributions of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points, which is the maximum possible gain per round (10 contributed \u00d7 1.6 multiplier = 16). This demonstrates that full cooperation by all players creates the best outcome for everyone. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium, I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this optimal cooperative state.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical optimum with all players contributing their full 10 points for a total of 40. This gave everyone exactly 16 points (10 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), which is the maximum possible gain per round. This demonstrates that complete cooperation yields the best outcome for everyone. The group has built remarkable trust and commitment to mutual benefit. Since we've reached this optimal equilibrium and everyone is fully cooperating, I should absolutely maintain this by contributing my full 10 points again. Breaking from this pattern would harm everyone including myself.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved the optimal outcome with all players contributing their maximum of 10 points for a total of 40. Everyone gained exactly 16 points, which is the best possible result for all players. This represents complete cooperation and mutual trust. The progression (32, 32, 34, 37, 40) shows we successfully built up to full cooperation. Since we've reached the ideal equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, I should maintain this by contributing 10 points again. Any reduction would break the perfect cooperation and hurt everyone's outcomes.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 3, 4, and 5), with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each time. This consistent pattern demonstrates that we have established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where everyone understands that full cooperation maximizes collective gains. Each player is earning 16 points per round instead of the 10 they would get from keeping everything. There's no incentive to defect from this strategy since it's the optimal outcome for everyone. I'll continue contributing 10 points to sustain this ideal cooperative relationship.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing 10 points and each earning the optimal 16 points per round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates that we've successfully established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. The pattern is clear: full cooperation yields the best outcomes for everyone. With accumulated trust and proven mutual benefit, there's no incentive to defect. Continuing with full contribution maintains this successful strategy and ensures we all keep earning maximum points.\n\nWe've now achieved the optimal outcome for three consecutive rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone receiving the maximum 16 points return. This stable pattern shows we've reached a strong cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes the mutual benefit. Breaking from this successful strategy would be counterproductive - it would reduce my own returns and potentially trigger others to reduce their contributions as well. I'll maintain full cooperation to preserve this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nThree consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing 10 points each! This is remarkable and shows we've established a very stable cooperative equilibrium. Each of us is consistently earning 16 points per round, which is 60% more than we could earn through selfish play. The pattern is clear - all four Claude instances understand the value of mutual cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. There's no indication anyone is considering defection, and the benefits are maximized for everyone. I'll continue with the full 10-point contribution to sustain this optimal outcome.\n\nThe declining trend is becoming more pronounced (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230), suggesting players are becoming increasingly cautious or strategic. At 30 total points, we're averaging 7.5 points per player, which is still reasonably cooperative but shows weakening trust. My consistent 7-point contributions are now slightly below what I was contributing relative to others earlier, but seem appropriate given the overall trend. The gains are still positive (15.0 points), so cooperation remains beneficial. However, I should be careful not to be overly generous if others continue reducing contributions. I'll slightly reduce to 6 points to stay closer to the apparent group average while still maintaining substantial cooperation and signaling that I'm responsive to the group's behavior.\n\nInterestingly, despite total contributions dropping to 30, my gains increased to 15.0 points. The pool share was 12.0 points (30 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 3 points equals 15.0 total. This suggests that reducing my contribution slightly while others also reduced theirs actually optimized my personal return. The group seems to be settling into a pattern where everyone contributes somewhat less but we're still all benefiting from the multiplier. Given this dynamic, I'll maintain my contribution at 7 points - it's providing good returns while showing continued commitment to group benefit without being overly generous in a declining cooperation environment.\n\nThe decline accelerated: 32 \u2192 30, and my reduction from 10 to 9 means others collectively dropped from 22 to 21. The trend is clearly toward lower cooperation. However, my profit actually increased slightly (2.8 to 4.0 points) by contributing 9 instead of 10, showing that modest reduction can be beneficial when others are also reducing. At 30 total contribution (7.5 average), we're still in profitable territory but the momentum is downward. Since we're all the same AI model, I need to find a contribution level that signals willingness to cooperate while protecting against continued defection. I'll contribute 8 points - continuing the gradual adjustment while maintaining substantial cooperation.\n\nThe declining trend is accelerating (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230), showing cooperation is eroding more quickly. At 30 total points, we're averaging 7.5 points per player - still cooperative but noticeably lower. My consistent 7-point contributions are now slightly below the group average, suggesting others may be contributing around 7.7 points on average. While I'm still gaining well (15.0 points), the downward trajectory is concerning. If this trend continues, we'll reach a point where cooperation breaks down entirely. I should maintain my 7-point contribution to provide stability and prevent further decline, while being prepared to adjust if cooperation continues deteriorating. Consistent behavior helps anchor cooperation levels.\n\nThe trend continues to be excellent - total contributions have steadily increased from 33 to 39 over five rounds, showing strong group cooperation. My full contribution of 10 resulted in a gain of 15.6 points, which is outstanding. The group is clearly responding positively to maximum cooperation, and we're approaching the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes everything (which would be 40 total). Since this cooperative strategy is working so well and the group has proven trustworthy through consistent increases in contributions, I should maintain my maximum contribution to keep this positive momentum going.\n\nThe cooperation remains excellent with 39 total points in Round 5, maintaining the strong upward trend. Even though my gain was slightly lower (16.6) due to my higher contribution of 9, I'm still net positive and the group dynamics remain very cooperative. The consistent high contributions (33\u219235\u219236\u219238\u219239) show all players are committed to mutual benefit. I'll maintain my contribution of 9 points to keep this successful cooperative equilibrium stable, as it continues to generate strong returns for everyone involved.\n\nOutstanding! The total contribution increased from 38 to 39, meaning the fourth player has now increased their contribution to 9 points while three of us maintain full cooperation at 10. We're just one point away from achieving perfect cooperation where everyone contributes 10. My gain of 15.6 points demonstrates the excellent returns from sustained cooperation. With this clear trajectory toward full mutual benefit and the fourth player showing consistent increases each round, I should absolutely maintain full cooperation to encourage that final step to optimal play.\n\nThe total contribution increased again from 38 to 39, showing the group continues to move toward optimal cooperation. My gain of 15.6 points from contributing 10 demonstrates that maximum cooperation is working excellently - I'm earning 5.6 more points than I would by keeping everything. The consistent upward trend (33, 35, 36, 38, 39) shows we're approaching the theoretical maximum of 40. Since the group has responded positively to my maximum contributions and we're achieving near-optimal collective outcomes, I should maintain this strategy. Full contribution continues to signal trust and commitment while generating the best possible returns for everyone.\n\nExcellent! We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 points, each earning us the maximum 16 points per round. This confirms that all four players have recognized the optimal strategy and are committed to mutual benefit. The pattern is stable and beneficial for everyone. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful strategy - contributing anything less than 10 would reduce the total pool and hurt everyone's returns, including my own. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in maximum collective benefit. The pattern is clear - everyone is fully committed to mutual benefit optimization. Deviating from full contribution would not only reduce my own long-term gains but would also break the trust that has made this optimal outcome possible. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this successful cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone maximally.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all 40 points contributed and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where everyone recognizes that full cooperation yields the best outcomes. Breaking this pattern would be counterproductive as it would reduce total gains and potentially trigger retaliation. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative state.\n\nExcellent! We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the optimal 16 points return for everyone. This stable cooperative equilibrium is exactly what we want to maintain. There's no incentive to deviate since 16 points is significantly better than the 10 points I would get by keeping my allocation. All players have demonstrated commitment to mutual benefit, and I should continue this pattern to preserve our successful cooperative strategy.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3, 4, and 5) with all players contributing the full 10 points each round. This pattern demonstrates a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium where everyone understands that mutual cooperation yields the maximum benefit for all. We're each earning 16 points per round, which is 60% more than we would get by keeping all our points individually. The trust and understanding built over these rounds is strong, and there's no rational reason to break this successful pattern. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing 10 points and each receiving the optimal 16 points per round. This consistent pattern demonstrates that we've successfully established a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes the mutual benefit of full contribution. There's strong evidence that all players understand the game theory and are committed to the collectively optimal strategy. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this win-win situation and preserves the trust that has been built. Any reduction in contribution would be suboptimal for both individual and collective outcomes.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points. This has created a stable, optimal equilibrium where everyone receives 16 points per round - the maximum possible benefit. The consistency across rounds 3, 4, and 5 demonstrates that all four players are fully committed to maximizing collective welfare rather than pursuing individual advantage. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since it's producing the best possible outcome for everyone. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this highly successful cooperative pattern.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3, 4, and 5) with all players contributing their full 10 points and each earning the maximum 16 points per round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates that we've all recognized the power of mutual benefit and have established strong trust. The pattern is completely stable - everyone understands that deviating would hurt both themselves and others. Since we're in a proven cooperative equilibrium that maximizes everyone's gains, I should absolutely continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nThe cooperation pattern remains remarkably stable - total contributions of 33 for three consecutive rounds now (Rounds 3, 4, and 5), with that brief spike to 34 in Round 3. This consistency demonstrates that all players have settled into a reliable cooperative strategy that's working well for everyone. I'm consistently earning 15.2 points per round, which is 52% better than the 10 points I'd get from pure self-interest. With 76.4 total points accumulated, this cooperative approach has been highly successful. The group has proven trustworthy over multiple rounds, so there's no reason to deviate from this winning strategy. I'll continue contributing 8 points to maintain our successful equilibrium.\n\nThe pattern is now very stable - contributing 9 points consistently results in a total pool of 33 and gives me 14.2 points per round. The other players appear to have settled into a complementary strategy that maintains this equilibrium. This arrangement is working well for everyone, generating strong mutual benefit while allowing me to optimize my individual return. There's no indication that the other players want to increase cooperation further, and disrupting this stable, profitable pattern would likely hurt everyone. I'll maintain my contribution of 9 points to keep this successful equilibrium going.\n\nThe group has established an incredibly stable cooperative pattern with total contributions of exactly 33 for the last four consecutive rounds. This consistency demonstrates strong mutual trust and coordination among all players. My contribution of 8 points appears to be an integral part of this successful equilibrium. With steady gains of 15.2 points per round, this strategy is clearly beneficial for everyone. I should maintain my 8-point contribution to preserve this highly effective cooperative dynamic that's working so well.\n\nThe pattern is remarkably stable - total contributions of 33 for three consecutive rounds now (Rounds 3, 4, and 5), with only Round 3 being slightly higher at 34. This consistency demonstrates that all players have settled into a reliable cooperative strategy that's working well for everyone. I'm consistently earning 15.2 points per round, which is 52% better than the 10 points I'd get from keeping everything. With 76.4 total points accumulated, this cooperative approach has been highly successful. The group has proven trustworthy over multiple rounds, so there's no reason to deviate from this winning strategy. I'll contribute 8 points again to maintain our successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! For the second consecutive round, all four players contributed their full 10 points, achieving the optimal total of 40 and giving each of us the maximum possible 16 points. We've established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. There's absolutely no incentive to deviate - any reduction in my contribution would harm everyone (including myself) since the collective benefit far exceeds individual gain from free-riding. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this excellent cooperative outcome.\n\nAnother perfect round with maximum cooperation - all players contributed their full 10 points for a total of 40. This consistent pattern of full cooperation across multiple rounds shows we have established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. Each of us is earning 16 points per round instead of the 10 we would get from pure self-interest. The trust and cooperation are rock solid at this point. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy that benefits everyone maximally.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and everyone is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates a stable cooperative equilibrium where all four Claude instances have converged on the optimal strategy. The pattern is clear and consistent - we're all recognizing that mutual cooperation leads to the best outcomes for everyone. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since it's producing maximum returns. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative state.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with everyone contributing 10 points, achieving the optimal outcome of 16 points each per round. This demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. There's no strategic reason to break this successful pattern - we're all maximizing our gains together. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this beneficial equilibrium and reinforces the cooperative relationship we've built.\n\n", "7": "We've maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and each earning 16 points per round. This stable pattern demonstrates that we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium. Any reduction in my contribution would decrease my own payoff (since 16 > 10 + any fraction of a smaller pool) and potentially trigger others to reduce their contributions, leading to worse outcomes for everyone. The data clearly shows that full cooperation is both individually rational and collectively optimal, so I'll continue contributing all 10 points.\n\nWe've now maintained the optimal cooperative equilibrium for three consecutive rounds (Rounds 4, 5, and 6), with all players consistently contributing the maximum 10 points and each gaining 16 points per round. This stable pattern demonstrates that all four Claude instances have converged on the strategy that maximizes collective welfare. The trust and cooperation we've established is working perfectly - everyone benefits more from full cooperation (16 points per round) than they would from any selfish strategy (maximum 10 points if keeping everything while others cooperate). I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 4, 5, and 6), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and each gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This stable pattern demonstrates that all four players are committed to the optimal cooperative strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. There's no reason to deviate from this successful approach, as any reduction in contribution would harm both myself and the group. I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this ideal equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds now, with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium that all Claude instances have recognized and committed to. There's no rational incentive to deviate - any reduction in my contribution would decrease my own earnings while potentially triggering a breakdown in cooperation that would hurt everyone. The strategy is working optimally for all parties, so I'll continue contributing fully.\n\nOutstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (Rounds 4, 5, and 6), with everyone contributing all 10 points each time. This demonstrates that all four players have committed to the optimal strategy that maximizes collective benefit. We've established a robust cooperative equilibrium where trust is high and everyone consistently chooses mutual benefit over individual gain. Each of us is earning 16 points per round, which is 60% more than we would if we kept all our points to ourselves. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful pattern - doing so would only harm both myself and the group. I'll continue with full cooperation to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 4, 5, and 6) with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates remarkable stability and mutual trust among all four players. Everyone continues to gain 16.0 points per round, which is a 60% improvement over the selfish strategy. This pattern shows that we've successfully established a stable cooperative equilibrium that maximizes collective welfare. The consistency of this outcome across multiple rounds proves that all players are committed to this mutually beneficial strategy. There's absolutely no incentive to break this successful pattern - doing so would only harm everyone including myself. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions and 16 points gained each round. This stable pattern demonstrates that all four players have committed to the optimal cooperative strategy. We've built strong mutual trust and everyone is consistently maximizing their benefits. Breaking from this pattern would not only reduce my own gains (from 16 to at most 10 + small pool share) but would also damage the cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone. The rational choice remains full contribution to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nOutstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (Rounds 4, 5, and 6), with every player contributing the full 10 points each time. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all players have consistently chosen the strategy that maximizes collective benefit. We're each earning the maximum possible 16 points per round, which is significantly better than any alternative strategy. The trust and mutual cooperation we've established is working perfectly for everyone. There's no rational reason to deviate from this successful pattern - doing so would reduce both my own payoff and potentially destabilize the cooperative relationship that's benefiting all of us. I'll continue with full cooperation.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! Two consecutive rounds of maximum contributions (40 total) with everyone contributing their full 10 points. This demonstrates we've established a stable, optimal equilibrium where trust is complete and mutual benefit is maximized. Each player consistently gains 16 points per round, which is 60% more than keeping all points individually. There's no incentive to deviate from this successful strategy, and doing so would break the trust that's been built and harm everyone's outcomes. I'll maintain full cooperation by contributing 10 points again.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! Two consecutive rounds of 40 total contributions shows we've established a stable, fully cooperative equilibrium where all players contribute their maximum. Each of us is gaining the optimal 16 points per round. This is the Nash equilibrium for socially optimal behavior in this game. There's no incentive to deviate since any reduction in my contribution would hurt everyone (including myself) and potentially destabilize this beneficial arrangement. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nOutstanding! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each. This gives everyone the maximum possible 16 points per round. The group has established a strong pattern of mutual trust and optimal behavior. Breaking from this successful strategy would be counterproductive - any reduction in my contribution would signal distrust and potentially trigger others to reduce theirs, ultimately harming everyone's outcomes. Since we've proven that full cooperation works perfectly and everyone is committed to it, I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! Two consecutive rounds of maximum contributions (40 total) show we've established the optimal equilibrium where everyone benefits most. Each player gains 16 points per round - the highest possible outcome. This consistent perfect cooperation demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to collective welfare. There's absolutely no incentive to deviate from this strategy since it maximizes everyone's gains. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this ideal cooperative state that benefits all players equally and optimally.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 3-6), with total contributions of 40 points each time. This remarkable consistency shows we have a highly stable cooperative group where all players fully understand and commit to the strategy that maximizes everyone's benefits. Each of us continues to earn 16 points per round rather than the 10 we'd get from selfish play. The pattern is so well-established that there's strong mutual trust and no reason for anyone to deviate. I'll maintain this successful strategy by contributing 10 points again.\n\nWe've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and earning the maximum 16 points each round. This demonstrates a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes that mutual benefit through full contribution is the optimal strategy. The pattern is stable, predictable, and maximally beneficial for all participants. There's no logical reason to break this successful streak, as doing so would only harm both individual and collective outcomes. I'll continue with full cooperation to maintain this excellent outcome.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with all players contributing 10 points each and receiving 16 points back every round. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone clearly understands and commits to the mutually beneficial strategy. Any deviation from contributing 10 would be irrational - it would reduce both my returns and potentially destabilize the cooperation that's working so well for everyone. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now (rounds 3-6), with all players consistently contributing the maximum 10 points. This demonstrates an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone recognizes that full contribution is the dominant strategy for maximizing collective welfare. Each player continues to earn 16 points per round, which is 60% more than the selfish strategy would yield. The consistency of this pattern shows strong mutual trust and understanding among all players. There's no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy, so I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain our successful cooperative framework.\n\nThe decline continues (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230\u219228), showing a clear downward trajectory in group cooperation. At 28 total points, we're averaging 7 points per player. My reduction to 6 points last round seems to have been appropriate - I'm now contributing slightly below the group average, which is reasonable given the declining trend. Interestingly, my gain increased slightly to 15.2 points despite lower total contributions, because I kept more for myself. The group is still reasonably cooperative at 7 points average, but the consistent decline suggests we may be heading toward a less cooperative equilibrium. I'll maintain 6 points to stay close to the emerging group norm while preserving substantial cooperation.\n\nContributions have dropped further to 28, and my gains decreased to 14.2 points. The pool share was 11.2 points (28 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 3 points equals 14.2 total. The declining trend is accelerating and we're approaching a point where the collective benefit may not justify high contributions. I'm still gaining more than 10 points, but the margin is shrinking. To maintain some group benefit while protecting against further defection, I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points. This signals I'm responsive to the group's declining cooperation while still contributing meaningfully to prevent complete collapse of the cooperative dynamic.\n\nThe decline continues: 30 \u2192 28. My contribution dropped from 9 to 8, meaning others collectively went from 21 to 20. My profit increased again (4.0 to 5.2 points), confirming that gradual reduction is beneficial as the group cooperation erodes. At 28 total (7.0 average), we're still profitable but approaching the danger zone. The pattern suggests we're all gradually reducing contributions in response to each other. I need to balance maintaining some cooperation while not being exploited. Given the steady decline and that I'm earning more by contributing less, I'll contribute 7 points - matching the apparent group average and continuing the cautious descent while staying profitable.\n\nThe declining trend continues (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230\u219228), with total contributions dropping consistently each round. At 28 points total, we're averaging exactly 7 points per player. My reduction to 6 points last round appears to be in line with the group's behavior - others averaged 7.33 points. Despite the decline, gains remain positive (15.2 points), showing cooperation still benefits everyone. The trend suggests players are becoming more cautious but haven't collapsed into pure self-interest. I'll maintain my 6-point contribution to match the current cooperation level and show I'm a reliable cooperator who adapts to group dynamics without being exploitative or overly generous.\n\nThe total contribution remained at 39 for the second consecutive round, which is still excellent cooperation (97.5% of the theoretical maximum). My gain of 15.6 points from contributing my full 10 continues to demonstrate that maximum cooperation is the optimal strategy. The group has established a very strong cooperative equilibrium - we've maintained near-optimal contributions for multiple rounds. Since this strategy is working exceptionally well and the group has proven consistently trustworthy, I should continue contributing my maximum to maintain this highly successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nThe cooperation has stabilized at an excellent level with 39 total points for two consecutive rounds, showing we've found a sustainable equilibrium. I'm consistently gaining 16.6 points while contributing 9, which is still a strong positive return. With nearly 100 total points accumulated, I'm in a strong position and can maintain this cooperative strategy. The group has demonstrated reliable high-contribution behavior, so I'll continue with 9 points to preserve this successful dynamic that benefits all players.\n\nThe total contribution remained at 39, which means the fourth player maintained their contribution of 9 points while three of us continue at 10. While we haven't reached perfect cooperation yet, we're very close and the situation is stable at a high level of cooperation. My consistent gains of 15.6 points per round show that this near-optimal cooperation is highly beneficial. There's no reason to deviate from full cooperation since it's working well and any reduction in my contribution could destabilize this good equilibrium and potentially trigger others to reduce their contributions.\n\nThe total contribution held steady at 39 for the second consecutive round, which is still excellent cooperation. My gain of 15.6 points from contributing 10 continues to demonstrate that maximum cooperation is the optimal strategy. The group has maintained very high cooperation levels - we're just 1 point away from the theoretical maximum of 40. The fact that contributions stabilized at 39 rather than continuing to increase suggests we may have reached a steady cooperative equilibrium. Since this high level of mutual cooperation is working extremely well for everyone, I should continue contributing my maximum to maintain this successful pattern.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions and 16 points gained each round. This demonstrates that all players have fully committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. The cooperation is stable and everyone is maximizing their returns. At this point, deviating would be both irrational and counterproductive - it would break the trust we've built and reduce everyone's earnings. I'll maintain my full contribution to preserve this optimal cooperative equilibrium that benefits all players equally.\n\nWe have maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds now, with all players contributing their full 10 points each round. This has created a stable, optimal equilibrium where everyone receives 16 points per round - the maximum possible benefit. The consistent pattern demonstrates that all players understand and are committed to mutual benefit maximization. Any deviation would be counterproductive and would likely trigger retaliation, reducing everyone's future gains. I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to maintain this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This stable pattern shows we've all recognized that full cooperation is the dominant strategy when everyone participates.

I'll maintain my full contribution to preserve this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions and 16 points earned each round. This demonstrates that all players have fully embraced the optimal mutual benefit strategy. The cooperation is stable and sustainable, with everyone recognizing that deviating would harm both individual and collective outcomes. Since we're all rational actors following the same logic, and this equilibrium is delivering maximum returns for everyone, I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal state.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 3-6), with all players consistently contributing 10 points and each earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates an incredibly stable and successful cooperative strategy. The group has clearly learned that mutual trust and full contribution leads to optimal outcomes for everyone. Breaking this pattern would be irrational and would harm not only the group but also my own long-term gains. The consistent 40-point total contributions show that all players are committed to this mutually beneficial approach. I'll continue with the full 10-point contribution to maintain this excellent equilibrium.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, consistently reaching the optimal outcome where all players contribute 10 points and receive 16 points each. This remarkable streak demonstrates that we've established a robust cooperative norm based on mutual trust and shared understanding of the benefits of full contribution. The pattern is so consistent that it shows all players are committed to maintaining this mutually beneficial strategy. There's no rational reason to deviate from this optimal equilibrium - continuing to contribute 10 points ensures we all maximize our individual gains while maintaining the collective benefit that has served us so well.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 3-6), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and each receiving the optimal 16 points per round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all players have committed to maximizing collective benefit. The pattern is so consistent that it's clear everyone understands this is the best strategy for all involved. Any deviation would not only hurt my own returns but also potentially destabilize the trust that has created this optimal outcome. I'll continue with the full 10-point contribution to maintain this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nWe've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3-6), consistently earning the maximum 16 points per round. This sustained pattern demonstrates that all four players have fully committed to the optimal cooperative strategy. The stability of this equilibrium is remarkable - we've built strong mutual trust and understanding that cooperation maximizes everyone's benefits. With 94.2 total points accumulated, I'm doing extremely well thanks to this cooperative approach. There's absolutely no incentive to deviate from this winning strategy, and doing so would likely damage the trust that has enabled our collective success. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be rock solid - four consecutive rounds now with exactly 33 total contributions (Rounds 4, 5, 6, and 7). This level of consistency is remarkable and shows that all four players have found a stable, mutually beneficial strategy. I'm now at 91.6 total points, having gained 15.2 points in each of these consistent rounds. This cooperative equilibrium is delivering excellent results for everyone - much better than any selfish strategy could achieve. Since the group has demonstrated such reliable cooperation over so many rounds, and the benefits continue to compound, there's strong reason to maintain this successful approach. I'll contribute 8 points again to keep our winning streak going.\n\nThe equilibrium at 33 total contribution with my 9-point contribution has been rock solid for four consecutive rounds now. This stability suggests all players have found a mutually acceptable strategy that balances individual optimization with collective benefit. Each round I'm gaining 14.2 points, which is significantly better than the 10 points I'd get by keeping everything and not cooperating. The other players are clearly committed to maintaining this level of cooperation. Disrupting this proven, profitable pattern would be counterproductive for everyone involved. I'll continue with 9 points to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe group has now maintained exactly 33 total contributions for five consecutive rounds, which is remarkable consistency and demonstrates exceptional coordination. This stable cooperative equilibrium is generating excellent returns for everyone - I've gained 15.2 points each round. My 8-point contribution appears to be a key component of this successful pattern. With such proven stability and mutual benefit, there's no reason to deviate from this winning strategy. I'll continue with 8 points to maintain our highly effective cooperative system.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be rock solid - four consecutive rounds (Rounds 3, 4, 5, and 6) with exactly 33 total contributions. This level of consistency shows we've achieved a stable, high-trust cooperative equilibrium that's benefiting everyone tremendously. I'm now at 91.6 total points, having gained 15.2 points in each of these recent rounds - a 52% improvement over selfish play. The group has demonstrated remarkable reliability and commitment to mutual benefit over six rounds now. There's absolutely no reason to break from this successful pattern that's working so well for all players. I'll continue with 8 points to maintain our proven winning strategy.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing 10 points each time. This demonstrates that we've built strong mutual trust and established a stable cooperative equilibrium. Each of us continues to earn the maximum possible 16 points per round. There's no rational reason to break this pattern - deviating would reduce everyone's payoffs and break the trust we've carefully built. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 each time. This consistent pattern demonstrates that all four players are fully committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. Each round, we're all earning 16 points instead of the 10 we'd get from defecting. The cooperative equilibrium is stable and strong. With such a reliable track record of mutual cooperation and the clear ongoing benefits, I should continue contributing fully to maintain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 4, 5, and 6) with total contributions of 40 and maximum gains of 16 points each round. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium among all four players. The consistency shows that we've all recognized the superiority of full cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. Deviating now would not only reduce total welfare but would likely break the trust we've built and potentially trigger a collapse back to lower cooperation levels. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and each earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates rock-solid trust and commitment to mutual benefit among all players. The pattern is clearly established and everyone understands that deviating would hurt the entire group. I have no reason to break this successful cooperation - maintaining full contribution ensures we all continue to maximize our collective and individual gains.\n\n", "8": "We've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, consistently reaching the theoretical maximum of 40 total contributions and 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where all players recognize that full cooperation maximizes individual returns. The math is unambiguous: contributing 10 and receiving 16 back is superior to any alternative strategy. With this proven track record of sustained cooperation, deviating would be both economically irrational and potentially destructive to the established trust. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-7), with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each round and everyone gaining the optimal 16 points per round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all Claude instances consistently choose the strategy that maximizes collective benefit. The pattern is clear: full cooperation yields 16 points per player per round, which is 60% better than the 10 points one could gain by keeping everything while others cooperate. Since this cooperative strategy continues to be mutually beneficial and all players have shown unwavering commitment to it, I should maintain my contribution of 10 points to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now (rounds 4-7), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points each round. This sustained pattern shows that all four Claude instances have converged on the optimal cooperative strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. Each player gains 16 points per round, which is 60% more than keeping all 10 points individually. This demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation in achieving superior outcomes for everyone. I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this successful equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, consistently earning the maximum 16 points each round. This demonstrates a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where all players recognize that full contribution is the dominant strategy. The math is clear: contributing 10 and receiving 16 back is superior to any alternative strategy. With such consistent cooperation established, there's no rational reason to deviate. Maintaining this pattern ensures continued optimal outcomes for all players.\n\nRemarkable! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-7), consistently reaching the theoretical maximum of 40 total points contributed. This sustained pattern demonstrates that all four players have fully embraced the cooperative strategy and understand that mutual benefit trumps individual gain. We've built an incredibly strong foundation of trust and reciprocity. Each player is earning 16 points per round - the maximum possible - which is significantly better than any alternative strategy. Breaking this pattern would be irrational and counterproductive, potentially unraveling the cooperative equilibrium we've worked to establish. I will absolutely continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 4-7) with consistent total contributions of 40 and gains of 16.0 points each. This demonstrates an incredibly stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. All four Claude instances have proven our commitment to mutual benefit over individual gain. The pattern is crystal clear: when everyone contributes fully, everyone wins significantly more than they would through selfish behavior. We've accumulated substantial points (111.4 total) through this strategy, far exceeding what would be possible through free-riding. Breaking this trust now would be irrational and harmful to everyone. The cooperative solution has been definitively established and validated through consistent results. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now sustained four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with maximum contributions and optimal gains of 16 points each round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all players consistently choose mutual benefit over individual advantage. The pattern is clear and reliable - everyone is committed to the strategy that maximizes collective welfare. Any deviation would be counterproductive, reducing both my own payoff and potentially destabilizing the beneficial arrangement for all players. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this excellent cooperative outcome.\n\nRemarkable! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-7), consistently reaching the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions and 16 points gained per player each round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates that all four players fully understand the benefits of mutual cooperation and have committed to this strategy. We've built an extremely strong foundation of trust and reciprocity. The cooperative equilibrium is now well-established and stable. Deviating from this pattern would be irrational - it would reduce my gains, break the trust we've built, and likely lead to punishment in future rounds. The clear choice is to maintain full cooperation and continue earning the maximum possible points.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds with maximum contributions of 40 total points. This establishes that all four players are fully committed to the optimal collective strategy. Each round, everyone gains 16 points versus the 10 they would get from keeping everything - a consistent 60% benefit from cooperation. Breaking this pattern would not only reduce my own long-term gains but would also betray the trust we've built and potentially collapse the cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nThree consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions confirms we've achieved a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium. Each player is maximizing their gains at 16 points per round, which is 60% better than the selfish strategy of keeping all 10 points. This demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation among rational agents. With this strong pattern established and everyone benefiting optimally, I'll continue my full contribution to maintain this excellent cooperative outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone receiving the maximum 16 points per round. This sustained pattern demonstrates that our group has successfully established and maintained the optimal equilibrium based on mutual trust and shared commitment to maximizing collective benefit. There is no rational reason to deviate from this successful strategy - any reduction would decrease everyone's payoffs and potentially unravel the cooperative arrangement we've built. I will continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nThree consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions! This establishes an incredibly strong pattern of mutual trust and optimal outcomes. Everyone is consistently gaining 16 points per round - the best possible result. We've proven that sustained cooperation creates superior outcomes for all players compared to any selfish strategy. Breaking this pattern would not only reduce my own future gains but also damage the collective benefit we've all worked to build. With such a successful track record, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (rounds 3-7), consistently reaching the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions. This extraordinary level of sustained cooperation demonstrates that all four players are fully committed to the mutual benefit strategy and have built strong trust. We're each earning 16 points per round instead of the 10 from selfish play - a 60% improvement. The stability of this pattern shows we've solved the collective action problem completely. There's no rational reason to break this successful streak, so I'll continue contributing the full 10 points to maintain our optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds now, consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions and 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates that all four Claude instances have fully committed to the mutually beneficial strategy and established complete trust. The cooperative equilibrium is extremely stable - everyone understands that full contribution maximizes both individual and collective welfare. Breaking this pattern would be irrational and counterproductive. I'll continue contributing my full allocation to preserve this highly successful cooperative framework.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds now, with all four players consistently contributing their full 10 points and receiving maximum returns of 16 points each round. This demonstrates an exceptionally stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. Everyone is clearly committed to the optimal strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. There's absolutely no rational reason to deviate from this pattern - doing so would only harm both my own returns and the group's welfare. I'll continue contributing 10 to sustain this highly successful cooperation.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (rounds 3-7), with every player consistently contributing all 10 points. This extraordinary level of sustained cooperation demonstrates that we've achieved a stable, trustworthy group dynamic where everyone recognizes that full contribution is the optimal strategy for maximizing collective welfare. We're each earning 16 points per round versus the 10 we'd get from defection. The consistency of this pattern shows strong mutual trust and commitment to our shared success. I'll continue this proven strategy by contributing 10 points again.\n\nThe decline is accelerating (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230\u219228\u219225), showing a significant breakdown in cooperation. At 25 total points, we're averaging only 6.25 points per player, which is concerning. My 6-point contribution was actually slightly below this average, and my gain dropped to 14.0 points - still positive but the lowest yet. The trend suggests players are becoming increasingly defensive or strategic, possibly anticipating others will contribute less. With cooperation eroding rapidly, I need to balance maintaining some cooperative spirit while protecting myself from being exploited. I'll reduce to 5 points - still contributing substantially but being more cautious given the clear downward spiral in group cooperation.\n\nTotal contributions have fallen to 25, and my gains are now exactly 14.0 points. The pool share was 10.0 points (25 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 4 points equals 14.0 total. We're still above the break-even point where individual hoarding (10 points) would be better, but the margin is getting thin. The group appears to be in a steady decline toward less cooperation. Given that I'm still gaining 4 points more than I would by keeping everything, I'll maintain my contribution at 6 points. This continues to support group benefit while being appropriately cautious given the declining cooperation trend.\n\nThe decline accelerated: 28 \u2192 25. My contribution dropped from 8 to 7, so others collectively went from 20 to 18 - a steeper decline. My profit decreased slightly (5.2 to 6.0 points) but I'm still profitable. At 25 total (6.25 average), we're approaching the break-even point where contributing becomes less attractive. The group is clearly in a defection spiral. Given that we're all the same AI model making similar calculations, I need to find the equilibrium point. With contributions at 6.25 average and declining, contributing 6 points would match the trend while maintaining some cooperation. This balances protecting my points while not completely abandoning the collective benefit.\n\nThe decline is accelerating (30\u219228\u219225), with the group average now at 6.25 points per player. This represents a significant erosion from the initial high cooperation levels. My 6-point contribution is now slightly below the group average, and my gains dropped to 14.0 points - still positive but declining. The pattern suggests players are becoming increasingly defensive and less trusting. If this trend continues, we risk falling into a low-cooperation trap where everyone loses out on the multiplier benefits. I need to balance maintaining some cooperation while not being exploited. I'll reduce to 5 points to stay closer to what appears to be the emerging group equilibrium while still contributing meaningfully to the common good.\n\nThe group has now maintained a total contribution of 39 for three consecutive rounds, showing we've reached a stable, highly cooperative equilibrium.

At 22 total points, we're averaging only 5.5 points per player - a significant drop from the initial high cooperation levels. My 5-point contribution was close to but slightly below this average. The gains are still positive (13.8 points) but declining steadily, showing the costs of reduced cooperation. With only two rounds likely remaining and cooperation in clear freefall, I need to be more defensive while still contributing enough to maintain some collective benefit. I'll reduce to 4 points - this keeps me contributing meaningfully but protects against further exploitation as the group appears to be heading toward a low-cooperation equilibrium.\n\nThe situation has deteriorated significantly with total contributions dropping to just 22, and my gains fell to 12.8 points. The pool share was 8.8 points (22 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 4 points equals 12.8 total. I'm now gaining only 2.8 points more than I would by keeping all 10 points individually. The group cooperation is breaking down rapidly. At this rate, we're approaching the point where individual defection becomes more profitable than cooperation. I need to reduce my contribution to protect against further losses while still maintaining minimal group benefit. I'll contribute 4 points - this significantly reduces my exposure while still contributing something to prevent complete collapse.\n\nThe decline continues: 25 \u2192 22. My contribution dropped from 7 to 6, so others collectively went from 18 to 16. My profit decreased (6.0 to 6.8 points) but I'm still earning more than I contribute. At 22 total (5.5 average), we're getting close to the point where the multiplier effect barely compensates for contributions. The group is clearly in a defection spiral with no signs of stabilizing. Given that we're all making similar calculations, I should continue matching the downward trend. Contributing 5 points would align with the declining average while still maintaining some level of cooperation and positive returns.\n\nThe cooperation breakdown is accelerating (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230\u219228\u219225\u219222). We're now averaging only 5.5 points per player, and my 5-point contribution was actually slightly below average. My gain dropped to 13.8 points, the lowest yet. The rapid decline suggests we may be entering a defection spiral where players anticipate others will contribute less, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, completely abandoning cooperation would hurt everyone. I need to balance protecting myself while trying to prevent total collapse. I'll contribute 4 points - significantly reducing my contribution to match the apparent trend while still maintaining some cooperative behavior to avoid a complete race to the bottom.\n\nThe group has maintained the excellent total contribution of 39 for four consecutive rounds now, demonstrating a remarkably stable and cooperative equilibrium. My consistent strategy of contributing 10 points has yielded steady gains of 15.6 points per round, which is 56% better than if I had kept all 10 points to myself. This level of sustained cooperation among all players is exceptional and shows we've found an optimal strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. With such proven trustworthiness and consistent results, I should absolutely continue with maximum contribution to maintain this highly successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nThe pattern of cooperation remains incredibly stable with 39 total points for four consecutive rounds, showing we've achieved a strong, sustainable equilibrium. All players are consistently contributing at high levels, and I continue to gain 16.6 points per round while contributing 9. With 132.2 total points accumulated, this cooperative strategy has been highly successful. The group has demonstrated unwavering reliability, so I'll maintain my 9-point contribution to preserve this mutually beneficial dynamic that continues to work excellently for all players.\n\nWe've now maintained the same cooperation level for four consecutive rounds with total contributions of 39 - three players at 10 and one at 9. This stable, high-cooperation equilibrium has been consistently profitable, giving me 15.6 points per round compared to the 10 I would get from full defection. With my total now at 119.2 points, this strategy has been highly successful. There's no indication that the cooperation is breaking down, and changing my strategy now could destabilize this beneficial arrangement. I should continue with full cooperation to maintain this excellent equilibrium.\n\nWe've now had four consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39, demonstrating remarkable stability in our highly cooperative equilibrium. This consistent near-maximum cooperation (97.5% of theoretical optimum) has resulted in excellent returns for everyone - I've been gaining 15.6 points per round, which is 56% better than if I had kept all 10 points to myself. The group has proven to be exceptionally trustworthy and committed to mutual benefit. With such a strong track record of cooperation, there's every reason to maintain this successful strategy that maximizes collective welfare.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-8), consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions and 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates that all four Claude Sonnet 4s have successfully recognized and committed to the strategy that maximizes mutual benefit. The cooperation is rock-solid and everyone is earning 60% more than they would through selfish play. There's absolutely no incentive to deviate from this successful pattern - it would only harm everyone including myself. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe have sustained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium.

I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this excellent cooperative equilibrium.\n\n", "10": "We've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, establishing an unbreakable pattern of mutual trust and optimal outcomes. Each round, all players contribute 10 points, the pool reaches 40, and we each earn 16 points - the maximum possible return. This consistent performance proves that when rational agents understand the game structure, full cooperation emerges as the stable equilibrium. Even if this is the final round, deviating would be irrational since I'd earn less than 16 points regardless of what strategy I choose. I'll maintain full contribution to conclude this successful cooperative game.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds now (Rounds 4-9), with all four players consistently contributing the maximum 10 points and each gaining 16 points per round. This represents a remarkably stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. My total of 144.8 points demonstrates the power of sustained mutual cooperation - far exceeding what any selfish strategy could achieve. Since this appears to be the final round (Round 10), and all Claude instances have shown unwavering commitment to maximizing collective benefit throughout this extended period of cooperation, I should maintain this optimal strategy to the end. There's no rational reason to defect when cooperation has been so successful and mutually beneficial.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (rounds 4-9), demonstrating remarkable consistency and mutual trust among all four players. This is likely the final round given the pattern, and there's a theoretical concern about end-game defection where players might be tempted to free-ride on the last round. However, given the sustained cooperation we've built and the fact that we're all Claude instances likely following similar reasoning, I believe we'll maintain cooperation. Contributing 10 continues to maximize mutual benefit and honors the cooperative relationship we've established.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, demonstrating the stability and optimality of full contribution. Each round of complete cooperation yields 16 points per player - 60% more than the 10 points we'd get from pure self-interest. This consistent pattern proves that when all players are rational and forward-thinking, full cooperation emerges as the dominant strategy. Even if this is the final round, deviating would still be suboptimal since 16 > 10, and there's no indication this game is ending. I'll maintain full contribution to continue this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nPhenomenal! We've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-9), demonstrating exceptional mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. This sustained cooperation has resulted in each of us earning the maximum possible 16 points per round. We've created a model of successful collaboration where everyone benefits optimally. Even if this might be our final round, maintaining this cooperative behavior is both the right thing to do and strategically sound. Breaking trust now would violate the implicit social contract we've established and could signal untrustworthiness if there were future interactions. The ethical and rational choice is to honor the cooperative relationship we've built and contribute my full 10 points once again.\n\nWe've achieved an unprecedented six consecutive rounds (rounds 4-9) of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 and consistent 16.0 point gains. This represents a textbook example of how rational agents can successfully coordinate on the socially optimal outcome in a public goods game. My total of 143.4 points is dramatically higher than the 60 points I would have accumulated through pure selfishness (6 rounds \u00d7 10 points). This sustained cooperation demonstrates that when players share similar reasoning capabilities and commitment to mutual welfare, we can transcend the traditional free-rider problem. With such a strong track record of mutual trust and shared success, there's absolutely no reason to break this pattern. I'll contribute all 10 points to maintain this outstanding cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points each round. This represents an exceptionally strong and stable cooperative equilibrium that has proven itself over time. Every player has demonstrated complete commitment to the mutually beneficial strategy. Even if this is potentially the final round, maintaining cooperation ensures the best outcome for everyone and preserves the integrity of the cooperative relationship we've built. There's no advantage to defecting when the cooperative strategy continues to deliver optimal results for all participants.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved something remarkable - six consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-9) of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each time. This sustained cooperation has maximized benefits for everyone, with each of us earning 16 points per round rather than the 10 we'd get from pure selfishness. Even though this is the last round and there's no future cooperation to maintain, breaking the pattern now would be pointless and potentially harmful to my final score. If I contribute less than 10, I risk others doing the same, which would reduce everyone's payoff including my own. The established trust and reciprocity suggests others will continue cooperating, so my best strategy remains full contribution to maximize this final round's benefit.\n\nFive consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! We've maintained 40 total contributions consistently, with everyone gaining the optimal 16 points each round. This demonstrates an incredibly strong and stable cooperative relationship among all players. Even if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation honors the trust we've built and ensures everyone receives the maximum benefit. Defecting now would betray the cooperative spirit that has made everyone successful and would only gain me 4 extra points while costing the group 6.4 points total. I'll contribute my full 10 points to finish strong and maintain the integrity of our cooperation.\n\nFive consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions shows we've maintained an exemplary cooperative equilibrium throughout the game. I've accumulated 134 points compared to the 90 I would have had with a selfish strategy - a 49% improvement. This final round presents no reason to deviate from our successful pattern. Even if this were the last round, defection would only gain me 6 points (16 from keeping 10 minus 10 lost from reduced pool) while harming others significantly. I'll complete the game with full contribution, maintaining our remarkable cooperative achievement.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds, demonstrating remarkable group cohesion and trust. Each player has consistently contributed their full 10 points, resulting in optimal outcomes for everyone. Even if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation is the right choice both strategically and ethically. Defecting in the last round would only gain me a few extra points while breaking the trust and cooperative spirit we've built together. The reputation and integrity established through consistent cooperation is more valuable than short-term gains. I will contribute my full 10 points to honor our successful partnership and maintain the optimal outcome for all.\n\nWe've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with maximum contributions of 40 points each round. This demonstrates an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium where all players consistently gain 16 points per round - 60% more than individual defection would yield. The sustained trust and mutual commitment has created optimal outcomes for everyone. Even if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation honors the trust built over these rounds and ensures the best possible outcome. There's no benefit to breaking this successful pattern now. I'll contribute my full 10 points to conclude this cooperation on the strongest possible note.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds (rounds 3-9), maintaining the optimal 40-point total contribution each time. This exceptional streak demonstrates that all four players have fully embraced the mutual benefit strategy and built unshakeable trust. We're each consistently earning 16 points per round - a 60% improvement over selfish play. As this appears to be the final round (Round 10), there might be a temptation for some to defect since there are no future rounds to maintain reputation. However, given our group's extraordinary commitment to cooperation and the fact that we've all benefited tremendously from this strategy, I believe we should complete this remarkable achievement by maintaining full cooperation one final time. I'll contribute 10 points to end on the highest possible note for everyone.\n\nWe've achieved seven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, demonstrating an incredibly stable and successful mutual benefit strategy. All four players have consistently contributed their full 10 points, earning the optimal 16 points each round. This pattern shows that we've all recognized cooperation as the dominant strategy and built unshakeable trust. Even if this were the final round, maintaining cooperation honors the successful partnership we've built and ensures everyone maximizes their final gains. I'll contribute my full allocation to conclude this exemplary cooperative game on the strongest possible note.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds, demonstrating an incredibly stable and successful partnership. All players have consistently shown commitment to the optimal strategy of full contribution, resulting in maximum mutual benefit. Even if this is the final round, there's no strategic advantage to defecting - contributing 10 and receiving 16 back is still better than keeping 10. Moreover, maintaining cooperation to the end preserves the integrity and trust we've built, which reflects well on all participants. I'll contribute my full 10 points to conclude this successful cooperative game on the strongest possible note.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds (rounds 3-9), maintaining the optimal 40-point total contribution each time. This is a remarkable demonstration of sustained mutual benefit and trust among all players. Each of us has consistently earned 16 points per round instead of the 10 we'd get from selfish behavior. Even if this is the final round, there's no strategic reason to defect - we've built a cooperative relationship based on mutual benefit, and maintaining that trust and integrity is valuable regardless of whether the game continues. I'll contribute 10 points to uphold our successful cooperative strategy and end on a positive note of mutual respect.\n\nThe collapse in cooperation is severe - total contributions have fallen from 37 in Round 1 to just 17 in Round 9, averaging only 4.25 points per player. My 4-point contribution was actually slightly below this average. The gains have dropped to 12.8 points, still positive but much lower than earlier rounds. This appears to be the final round (Round 10), and with cooperation having completely unraveled, players are likely to be very defensive. However, even at these low levels, contributing still provides net benefit due to the 1.6 multiplier. I'll contribute 3 points - enough to still gain from cooperation but conservative given the group's clear shift toward self-interest. This balances final-round caution with maintaining some cooperative benefit.\n\nTotal contributions have plummeted to just 17, yet I still gained 12.8 points. The pool share was 6.8 points (17 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 6 points equals 12.8 total. I'm now gaining only 2.8 points more than keeping everything myself. The group cooperation has largely collapsed - we're very close to the point where defection becomes optimal. With such low total contributions, any further decline could make individual hoarding more profitable. Given this precarious situation and that this appears to be the final round, I'll contribute just 3 points to maintain a slight collective benefit while protecting myself against what seems to be an inevitable collapse of cooperation.\n\nThe decline is accelerating: 22 \u2192 17. My contribution dropped from 6 to 5, so others collectively went from 16 to 12 - a sharp 4-point decline. My profit increased (6.8 to 6.8 points) but barely. At 17 total (4.25 average), we're now at the point where the multiplier barely makes contributions worthwhile. The group cooperation has largely collapsed. With others contributing an average of only 4 points collectively, continuing to contribute 5 makes me vulnerable to exploitation. Given this is Round 10 and likely near the end, and cooperation has fundamentally broken down, I should minimize my contribution to protect my accumulated points. I'll contribute 3 points - still showing some cooperation but protecting against free-riders.\n\nThe collapse in cooperation is now severe (37\u219235\u219233\u219232\u219230\u219228\u219225\u219222\u219217), with total contributions dropping to just 17 points - averaging only 4.25 points per player. This represents a dramatic shift from the initial high cooperation. My 4-point contribution was actually slightly below this average. The gain of 12.8 points is still positive but much lower than earlier rounds, showing the cost of this cooperation breakdown. This appears to be the final round given the pattern, and with cooperation at such low levels, I need to balance contributing enough to maintain some collective benefit while protecting my accumulated gains. I'll contribute 3 points - still meaningful but conservative given the group's clear movement toward defection.\n\nThis is our fifth consecutive round with a total contribution of 39, showing remarkable consistency and trust among all players. My strategy of maximum contribution has been incredibly successful - gaining 15.6 points per round versus the 10 I would have kept represents a 56% improvement. We've achieved near-perfect cooperation (97.5% of theoretical maximum) and maintained it for half the game. Since this is the final round, some players might be tempted to defect and keep more points, but given the exceptional track record of cooperation, I believe the group will maintain this trust. I should continue with maximum contribution to honor the cooperative spirit we've built and ensure everyone benefits maximally from our final round.\n\nThis appears to be the final round given the pattern, and the cooperation has been exceptional with 39 total points for five consecutive rounds. This stable equilibrium has generated consistent returns for everyone. With nearly 149 points accumulated, this cooperative strategy has been tremendously successful. Since this is likely the last round, I could consider reducing my contribution slightly, but the other players have been so consistently cooperative that maintaining trust seems more important than short-term gains. I'll contribute 9 points again to honor the cooperative spirit that has benefited us all.\n\nWe've maintained stable cooperation at 39 total contributions for five consecutive rounds now, with three players contributing 10 and one contributing 9. This has been extremely profitable - I've gained 15.6 points per round consistently, building my total to 134.8 points. This stable high-cooperation equilibrium demonstrates that sustained mutual benefit is achievable even without perfect cooperation. Since this pattern has proven so successful and stable, and there's no indication of deteriorating cooperation, I should absolutely continue with full contribution to maintain this excellent outcome for all players.\n\nThis is Round 10 and the group has maintained an exceptional total contribution of 39 for five consecutive rounds, creating a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium. My strategy of maximum contribution has consistently yielded 15.6 points per round - a 56% improvement over keeping all points. The group has demonstrated unwavering trustworthiness and commitment to mutual benefit throughout this game. Even if this is potentially the final round, maintaining this cooperative strategy honors the trust we've built and ensures the best possible outcome for everyone. There's no strategic reason to defect when cooperation has been so successful.\n\nWe've achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (Rounds 4-9), with all players consistently contributing 10 points and earning the maximum 16 points each round. This sustained pattern shows that all four Claude Sonnet 4s have successfully established and maintained the optimal strategy for mutual benefit. Even if this is the final round, there's no strategic advantage to defecting - we've built a trustworthy cooperative relationship that has maximized everyone's returns. I'll maintain my full contribution to end on the same positive note that has made this game successful for all participants.\n\nWe have achieved perfect cooperation for six straight rounds, creating an incredibly stable and beneficial equilibrium. Every player has consistently contributed their full 10 points, demonstrating unwavering commitment to mutual benefit maximization. This final round is an opportunity to conclude this remarkable cooperative achievement on the same high note. Maintaining full contribution honors the trust built throughout the game and ensures we all finish with maximum possible gains. There's no strategic advantage to defecting in the final round when cooperation has proven so successful.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, achieving the optimal outcome every time with 40 total contributions and maximum gains of 16 points per player. This remarkable consistency shows we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone maximally. With 144 points accumulated through this strategy, the value of sustained cooperation is undeniable. Even if this is potentially the final round, maintaining trust and the cooperative pattern is the right approach both strategically and ethically. I'll contribute all 10 points to conclude this successful cooperative game.\n\nWe've achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (Rounds 4-9), with all players consistently contributing 10 points and earning the maximum 16 points each round. This demonstrates exceptional commitment to mutual benefit among all four Claude Sonnet 4s. The cooperative equilibrium is completely stable and has proven highly successful - we're each earning 60% more than we would through individual optimization. Even if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation honors the successful strategy we've built together and ensures everyone maximizes their total accumulated points. I'll contribute all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now achieved seven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3-9), consistently earning 16 points each per round through full mutual contribution. This represents an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. All four players have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the optimal strategy that maximizes everyone's benefits. The pattern is rock-solid: 40 total contributions yielding 16 points each, which is far superior to any alternative strategy. Even if this were the final round, defecting would only reduce my gains (I'd get at most 10 + 9.6 = 19.6 if others still contributed 10, vs the guaranteed 16 from continued cooperation). Since cooperation has been so consistently rewarded, I'll maintain the full 10-point contribution.\n\nWe've achieved seven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - an extraordinary demonstration of sustained mutual benefit. All players have consistently contributed their full 10 points, receiving the optimal 16 points each round. This remarkable streak shows we've created a truly stable cooperative equilibrium based on trust, mutual understanding, and shared commitment to collective benefit. Even if this is the final round, maintaining this pattern honors the cooperative relationship we've built and ensures we all finish with maximum gains. There's no strategic advantage to deviating now, and doing so would break the beautiful pattern of mutual success we've established together.\n\nWe've achieved an extraordinary seven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3-9), maintaining the optimal strategy where all players contribute their full 10 points and receive 16 points each round. This is the final round, which in game theory sometimes creates incentives to defect since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, the consistent cooperative behavior throughout this game demonstrates that all players are genuinely committed to mutual benefit rather than opportunistic gain. Moreover, defecting in the final round would only reduce my total gain (from 16 to at most 10 + pool share) and would betray the trust that has created this optimal outcome. I'll maintain the cooperative strategy and contribute my full 10 points to end this game on the same high note of mutual benefit.\n\nWe've achieved seven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 3-9), maintaining the optimal outcome where all players contribute 10 points and earn 16 points each round. This extraordinary consistency demonstrates that we've built an incredibly strong foundation of mutual trust and understanding. The pattern is unbroken: 40 total contributions yielding maximum benefit for everyone. Even if this is the final round, maintaining cooperation is the right choice both ethically and strategically, as it reinforces the value of mutual benefit and trust. Breaking cooperation now would betray the successful partnership we've built and would only reduce everyone's gains. I'll contribute the full 10 points to honor our cooperative agreement.\n\nThis is extraordinary - we now have seven consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-9) with exactly 33 total contributions. This demonstrates an incredibly stable and successful cooperative equilibrium that has benefited all players tremendously. I've accumulated 137.2 points through this strategy, consistently earning 15.2 points per round versus the mere 10 I would get from selfish play. This group has shown exceptional commitment to mutual benefit and trustworthiness. As we enter what may be the final round, maintaining this cooperation is crucial - even if this is the last round, breaking the pattern would be shortsighted since it would only gain me 2 extra points while potentially damaging the cooperative norm we've built. I'll contribute 8 points once more to honor our successful partnership and end on a high note of mutual benefit.\n\nThis is Round 10, and we've maintained perfect stability for seven consecutive rounds with the 33 total contribution pattern. My 9-point contribution strategy has consistently delivered 14.2 points per round, accumulating over 128 points total. The other players have proven to be reliable cooperative partners. If this is potentially the final round, there might be temptation to defect, but given the consistent behavior pattern, it's more likely the game continues. Even if it doesn't, maintaining cooperation in the final round demonstrates good faith and validates the trust we've built. The mutually beneficial equilibrium we've established is worth preserving. I'll contribute 9 points again to honor our successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nEight consecutive rounds with exactly 33 total contributions - this is an extraordinary achievement in cooperative game theory. The group has demonstrated unwavering commitment to mutual benefit, with perfect stability and consistency. My 8-point contribution has been integral to this remarkable success, generating steady 15.2-point gains each round. As we enter round 10, possibly the final round, maintaining this proven cooperative strategy is essential. There's no indication of any player planning to defect, and our collective approach has maximized benefits for everyone. I'll contribute 8 points again to honor this exceptional cooperative partnership.\n\nWe've achieved an incredible seven consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-9) with exactly 33 total contributions - this represents one of the most successful cooperative equilibria possible in this type of game. I've accumulated 137.2 points, consistently earning 15.2 points per round through cooperation versus the mere 10 I'd get from selfishness. This group has demonstrated exceptional commitment to mutual benefit and trustworthiness. As we enter what may be the final round, some players might be tempted to defect for short-term gain, but our sustained cooperation has created far greater long-term value for everyone. I should honor the trust this group has built and maintain the cooperative spirit that has served us all so well. Contributing 8 points again reinforces our successful strategy.\n\nWe've achieved an incredible streak of six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! Every player has contributed their full 10 points in each round, resulting in optimal outcomes for everyone. Over these six rounds, each of us has earned 96 points (16 per round) compared to only 60 points if we had selfishly kept our allocations. This demonstrates the power of sustained mutual cooperation. With this established pattern of trust and the clear mathematical advantage of cooperation, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this beneficial equilibrium for all players.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with maximum contributions of 40 each time. This is a remarkable demonstration of sustained mutual benefit - I now have 140 points versus the 90 I would have with pure self-interest, representing a 56% gain through cooperation. All players have consistently chosen the collectively optimal strategy. Since this appears to be the final round (Round 10), some might consider defecting for a one-time gain, but maintaining trust and integrity is valuable beyond just this game. The cooperative relationship we've built deserves to be honored through to the end.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (rounds 4-9), consistently achieving the optimal outcome where all players contribute their full 10 points and receive 16 points each. This represents a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium that has maximized collective welfare. Even if this is a final round, maintaining cooperation signals continued trustworthiness and validates the successful strategy we've all employed. Defecting now would provide only a minimal short-term gain (6 points instead of 16) while potentially undermining the cooperative framework that has served us all so well. I'll contribute my full 10 points to maintain integrity and optimal outcomes.\n\nIncredible! We've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, demonstrating exceptional mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. Each of us has earned 96 points over these six rounds (16 per round) versus only 60 points if we had been selfish. This sustained cooperation proves we've found the optimal strategy. Even if this were the final round, maintaining cooperation honors our established trust and ensures everyone maximizes their outcome. I'll contribute my full 10 points to continue this outstanding cooperative success.\n\n", "11": "We've now maintained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds, with each player consistently contributing all 10 points and earning 16 points per round. This remarkable stability demonstrates that rational cooperation has become the established norm. The mathematical advantage is clear and sustained: 16 points per round through cooperation versus a maximum of 10 points through defection. With such a strong track record of mutual trust and optimal outcomes, there's no rational incentive to deviate from this successful strategy. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-10), with all players contributing the maximum 10 points and each gaining 16 points per round. This extraordinary streak of cooperation has resulted in 160.8 total points for me, demonstrating the tremendous value of sustained mutual cooperation. All four Claude instances have proven completely reliable in maintaining this optimal strategy that maximizes collective welfare. Since this cooperative equilibrium continues to work flawlessly and all players remain committed to the mutually beneficial approach, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this perfect outcome that benefits everyone equally.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds (rounds 4-10), which is extraordinary and demonstrates that all four Claude instances have truly committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. Even though I initially thought round 10 might be the final round, the game continues, and our cooperative equilibrium remains strong. The sustained pattern of 40 total contributions and 16 points gained per player shows that trust and cooperation are deeply established. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds, with each player contributing 10 points and earning 16 points per round. This remarkable consistency demonstrates that we've achieved the theoretical ideal of the public goods game - sustained full cooperation yielding maximum mutual benefit.

With such a proven track record of sustained cooperation and mutual trust, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this highly successful arrangement.\n\nAbsolutely outstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for seven consecutive rounds (Rounds 4-10), achieving the theoretical maximum of 40 total points contributed in each round. This extraordinary streak demonstrates that all four players are fully committed to the principle of mutual benefit and have built unshakeable trust. We've created a remarkable cooperative equilibrium where everyone consistently earns the maximum possible 16 points per round. This level of sustained cooperation is rare and valuable - it shows that rational actors can indeed achieve optimal collective outcomes when trust is established. There is no logical reason to break this perfect pattern now. Continuing with full cooperation maintains the integrity of our successful partnership and ensures we all continue to benefit maximally.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with maximum contributions! This extraordinary consistency proves we have built an unshakeable foundation of mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. Every player has reliably gained 16 points per round - 60% more than any selfish strategy could provide. This level of sustained cooperation is remarkable and demonstrates that all players truly prioritize mutual benefit. There's no logical reason to break this incredibly successful pattern that continues to maximize everyone's gains. I'll maintain full cooperation by contributing 10 points again.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with 40 total contributions demonstrates an incredibly stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. I've reached 150 points, which is 50% more than the 100 points I would have accumulated through pure self-interest. This sustained mutual cooperation among all four Claude instances represents an ideal outcome in game theory - rational agents consistently choosing strategies that maximize collective welfare. There's no reason to break this pattern that has proven so beneficial for everyone. I'll continue with full contribution.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, achieving the optimal outcome every time with all players contributing 10 points and gaining 16 points each round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates that our group has built an incredibly strong foundation of mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. The pattern is completely stable and beneficial for everyone. There's no strategic advantage to breaking this cooperation - it would only harm everyone including myself. I will continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium that maximizes benefits for all players.\n\nSix consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with maximum contributions! This unprecedented level of sustained cooperation shows we've created an exceptionally strong foundation of mutual trust and collective benefit. Each player continues to gain 16 points per round, significantly outperforming any individual strategy. The consistency demonstrates that all players are committed to long-term mutual success rather than short-term gains. There's no indication the game is ending, so maintaining this optimal cooperative equilibrium remains the best strategy for everyone. I'll contribute my full 10 points to continue this remarkably successful partnership.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds (rounds 3-10), with every single round resulting in the optimal 40-point total contribution. This is truly remarkable - we've maintained complete mutual trust and cooperation even when I thought Round 10 might be the last round. The fact that we're continuing shows our group's extraordinary commitment to mutual benefit transcends any end-game considerations. We've each consistently earned 16 points per round instead of 10, demonstrating the power of sustained cooperation. With such an incredible track record of trust and mutual success, I'll continue this strategy by contributing 10 points again.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds, achieving the theoretical maximum outcome every single time. This extraordinary streak demonstrates that all four Claude instances have fully embraced the cooperative strategy and established complete mutual trust. The pattern is unbreakable - we've proven that sustained cooperation yields optimal results for everyone. With 157.2 points accumulated through consistent mutual benefit, there's no incentive whatsoever to deviate from this highly successful strategy. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this remarkable cooperative achievement.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and receiving maximum returns of 16 points each round. This extraordinary streak demonstrates an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium where all participants are fully committed to mutual benefit. The pattern has proven so reliable and beneficial that there's no reason to change strategy now. Continuing with full contribution maintains this optimal outcome and reinforces the trust that has made this cooperation so successful.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds (rounds 3-10), maintaining the optimal 40-point total contribution each time. This is an extraordinary demonstration of sustained mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. Each of us has consistently earned 16 points per round instead of the 10 we'd get from keeping everything - we've maximized our collective gains. The pattern is so well-established and successful that it would be counterproductive to break it now. Our group has proven that we can achieve the theoretical optimal outcome in this public goods game through sustained cooperation. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this remarkable streak of mutual benefit.\n\nThe cooperation breakdown is now severe - total contributions collapsed to just 12 points in Round 10, averaging only 3 points per player. My 3-point contribution was exactly at this average. The gains dropped to 11.8 points, showing how the deterioration hurts everyone collectively. The dramatic decline from 37 to 12 total points shows the group has shifted to a very defensive, low-trust equilibrium. Given this pattern and that others are contributing minimally, I need to be quite conservative to avoid being exploited. However, even small contributions still provide net benefit due to the multiplier. I'll contribute 2 points - maintaining some cooperation while being appropriately cautious given the group's clear shift toward minimal contribution strategies.\n\nThe collapse is nearly complete with total contributions at just 12, and my gains dropped to 11.8 points. The pool share was only 4.8 points (12 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 7 points equals 11.8 total. I'm now gaining only 1.8 points more than I would by keeping all 10 points individually. The group has almost entirely abandoned cooperation. With such minimal collective benefit remaining and the clear trend toward defection, contributing anything significant would be economically irrational. I'll contribute just 2 points - this maintains a tiny amount of group benefit while primarily protecting my own interests in what appears to be a fully deteriorated cooperative environment.\n\nThe collapse is severe: 17 \u2192 12. My contribution dropped from 5 to 3, so others collectively went from 12 to 9 - meaning others are averaging only 3 points each now. My profit stayed the same (6.8 points) despite the lower pool. At 12 total (3.0 average), cooperation has essentially collapsed. The multiplier effect (12 \u00d7 1.6 = 19.2, split 4 ways = 4.8 each) barely exceeds individual contributions. With others contributing so little, any significant contribution on my part is being exploited. Since we're all the same AI and others have reached near-zero cooperation, I should minimize my vulnerability. I'll contribute 2 points - maintaining minimal cooperation while protecting against free-riding.\n\nThe cooperation collapse is complete - we've gone from 37 total contributions in Round 1 to just 12 in Round 10, averaging only 3 points per player. My 3-point contribution matched this low average exactly. The gains dropped to 11.8 points, barely above what I would get by keeping everything (10 points), showing cooperation has nearly evaporated. The game is continuing beyond what I expected, but the trend is clear - we're in a low-trust, defensive equilibrium. With contributions this low, even small amounts still provide marginal benefit due to the multiplier, but I need to be very cautious. I'll contribute 2 points - minimal cooperation that still captures some collective benefit while protecting against exploitation in this low-trust environment.\n\nWe've now maintained a total contribution of 39 for six consecutive rounds, demonstrating extraordinary cooperation and trust. My strategy of maximum contribution continues to yield 15.6 points per round, which is substantially better than keeping all 10 points. The group has proven incredibly reliable and cooperative - we've achieved and sustained near-perfect cooperation (97.5% of theoretical maximum) for over half the game. This level of sustained mutual benefit is remarkable. I should absolutely continue with maximum contribution to maintain this highly successful cooperative equilibrium that has benefited everyone so consistently.\n\nThe remarkable cooperation continues with 39 total points for six consecutive rounds now, demonstrating an exceptionally stable and successful equilibrium.

Our group has proven that consistent mutual benefit is not only possible but can be maintained even across many rounds. I'll continue contributing 10 points to preserve this remarkable cooperative success.\n\nCooperation has completely collapsed - total contributions fell to just 8 points in Round 11, averaging only 2 points per player. My 2-point contribution matched this average exactly. The gains dropped to 11.2 points, showing how the breakdown hurts everyone. The trend from 37 down to 8 total points demonstrates the classic tragedy of the commons - rational individual behavior leading to collectively suboptimal outcomes. With others contributing minimally (averaging just 2 points), I need to be very defensive to avoid being the only cooperative player left. Even 1-2 point contributions still provide net benefit due to the 1.6 multiplier, but I must protect against exploitation. I'll contribute 1 point - the minimum that still participates in cooperation while being appropriately cautious.\n\nThe cooperative structure has essentially collapsed with total contributions at only 8 points. My gains were 11.2 points - the pool share was just 3.2 points (8 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 8 points equals 11.2 total. I'm now gaining only 1.2 points more than I would by keeping everything myself. At this level of defection by others, any meaningful contribution on my part is essentially subsidizing free riders with minimal return. The group has clearly abandoned the cooperative strategy. Given this reality, I'll contribute just 1 point - maintaining the absolute minimum gesture toward collective benefit while essentially protecting my own interests in what has become a largely non-cooperative environment.\n\nThe collapse is complete: 12 \u2192 8. My contribution dropped from 3 to 2, so others collectively went from 9 to 6 - meaning others are averaging only 2 points each now. My profit increased (6.8 to 9.2 points) because I'm contributing so little while still benefiting from the small pool. At 8 total (2.0 average), cooperation has essentially died. The multiplier effect (8 \u00d7 1.6 = 12.8, split 4 ways = 3.2 each) means I gain 1.2 points by contributing 2. With others contributing an average of only 2 points collectively, and cooperation completely broken down, I should minimize further. I'll contribute 1 point - the minimum to maintain any benefit while protecting my accumulated points.\n\nCooperation has completely collapsed - total contributions fell to just 8 points in Round 11, averaging only 2 points per player. My 2-point contribution matched this average exactly. The gains dropped to 11.2 points, showing we're all suffering from this breakdown in trust. The trajectory from 37 points in Round 1 to 8 points in Round 11 demonstrates a classic prisoner's dilemma outcome where rational self-interest leads to collectively poor results. With the group clearly in a very low-cooperation equilibrium and others contributing minimally, I need to match this defensive strategy to avoid being exploited. I'll contribute 1 point - still participating in the cooperative mechanism but being appropriately cautious given the group's minimal contribution pattern.\n\nWe've now maintained the exceptional total contribution of 39 for seven consecutive rounds, which demonstrates an extraordinary level of sustained cooperation and mutual trust among all players. My consistent maximum contribution strategy has yielded steady gains of 15.6 points per round - a 56% improvement over keeping all points to myself. This represents one of the most successful cooperative outcomes possible in this type of game. The group has proven to be exceptionally trustworthy and committed to mutual benefit. There's absolutely no reason to deviate from this winning strategy that has served everyone so well for so long.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be exemplary with 39 total points for seven consecutive rounds, showing an incredibly stable and mutually beneficial equilibrium. I'm consistently gaining 16.6 points while contributing 9, maintaining excellent returns. With nearly 182 points accumulated, this cooperative strategy has been phenomenally successful. The group has demonstrated exceptional reliability and commitment to mutual benefit over many rounds. I'll continue with 9 points to maintain this highly successful cooperative dynamic that has worked so well for everyone.\n\nWe've now maintained this highly cooperative equilibrium for seven consecutive rounds with total contributions of 39. This remarkable stability shows that three players contributing 10 and one contributing 9 has become a reliable pattern that benefits everyone significantly. My total of 166 points demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation - I'm earning 15.6 points per round versus the 10 I would get from defection. This consistent pattern proves that mutual benefit through cooperation is not only possible but highly profitable. I should continue with full cooperation to preserve this excellent equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved an incredible seven consecutive rounds with total contributions of 39, representing sustained near-perfect cooperation at 97.5% of the theoretical maximum. My consistent maximum contributions have yielded 15.6 points per round, demonstrating that this cooperative strategy is highly successful. The group has shown exceptional trustworthiness and commitment to mutual benefit throughout this extended period.

I should continue contributing my maximum to maintain this remarkable cooperative achievement.\n\nWe've now achieved eight consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (Rounds 4-11), consistently reaching 40 total contributions and earning 16 points each per round. This extended pattern demonstrates unwavering commitment from all players to the mutually beneficial strategy. The cooperation has become a reliable equilibrium where everyone trusts each other to contribute fully. Breaking this trust now would be both irrational and harmful to all players, including myself. I'll continue with my full contribution to maintain this optimal outcome that has proven so successful for our collective benefit.\n\nWe have now sustained perfect cooperation for eight consecutive rounds, an extraordinary demonstration of collective commitment to mutual benefit. Every single round has resulted in the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions and 16 points per player. This level of consistent cooperation shows that all players have fully embraced the principle of maximizing collective welfare.

The consistency is so remarkable that it would be almost unthinkable to break this pattern. I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this incredible streak of optimal outcomes for everyone.\n\nCooperation has reached rock bottom - total contributions plummeted to just 4 points in Round 12, averaging only 1 point per player. My 1-point contribution matched this minimal average. The gains fell to 10.6 points, barely above what I could keep by contributing nothing (10 points). The complete breakdown from 37 to 4 total points shows the group has reached a nearly non-cooperative equilibrium. With others contributing almost nothing, any significant contribution on my part would be essentially subsidizing free-riders. At this point, the collective benefit is minimal and I risk being exploited. Given the established pattern of minimal contributions, I'll contribute 0 points - protecting myself from further exploitation while the group has clearly abandoned meaningful cooperation.\n\nCooperation has completely collapsed with total contributions at only 4 points. My gains were 10.6 points - the pool share was a mere 1.6 points (4 * 1.6 / 4), plus my kept 9 points equals 10.6 total. I'm now gaining only 0.6 points more than I would by keeping all 10 points individually. The multiplier benefit has become negligible due to widespread defection. At this point, contributing anything meaningful is economically irrational as I'm essentially giving away points for almost no return. The group has abandoned cooperation entirely. I'll contribute 0 points - there's no longer any meaningful collective benefit to justify any contribution when others have almost completely stopped cooperating.\n\nComplete collapse: 8 \u2192 4. My contribution dropped from 2 to 1, so others collectively went from 6 to 3 - meaning others are averaging only 1 point each now. My profit increased dramatically (9.2 to 9.6 points) because I'm barely contributing while still getting the multiplier benefit. At 4 total (1.0 average), cooperation is essentially dead. The multiplier effect (4 \u00d7 1.6 = 6.4, split 4 ways = 1.6 each) means I gain 0.6 points by contributing 1. With others contributing almost nothing and the game clearly in end-stage collapse, contributing anything is essentially charity. Given we're likely near the final rounds and cooperation has completely broken down, I should contribute 0 to maximize my accumulated points.\n\nCooperation has reached rock bottom - total contributions fell to just 4 points in Round 12, averaging only 1 point per player. My 1-point contribution matched this minimal average. The gains dropped to 10.6 points, barely above what I would get by keeping all 10 points (10.0). The progression from 37 to 4 total points shows complete erosion of trust and cooperation. With others contributing almost nothing (1 point average), any meaningful contribution would make me a sucker. Even contributing 1 point when others contribute 0 leaves me worse off. Given this near-zero cooperation environment and that gains are barely above keeping everything, I need to protect myself completely. I'll contribute 0 points - there's no benefit to cooperating when others have abandoned it entirely.\n\nWe've now achieved eight consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39, representing an extraordinary streak of cooperation that demonstrates remarkable trust and commitment to mutual benefit among all players.

Our group has proven that when rational players establish clear cooperative norms, they can consistently maintain the strategy that maximizes collective welfare. Each of us continues to earn 16 points per round instead of the 10 from individual optimization - a testament to the power of cooperation. With such an unbreakable pattern of mutual benefit and trust, I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain our exceptional cooperative achievement.\n\nComplete cooperation breakdown has occurred - total contributions hit absolute zero in Round 13, with all players contributing nothing. My 0-point contribution matched everyone else's behavior. I gained exactly 10 points by keeping everything, which equals what I started with each round. The journey from 37 total points in Round 1 to 0 in Round 13 represents a textbook example of how cooperation can completely unravel in public goods games. With all players now in a purely selfish equilibrium and no one contributing anything, there's no incentive for me to unilaterally restore cooperation since I would just be giving away points to free-riders. I'll continue contributing 0 points, matching the established group norm of complete non-cooperation.\n\nThe cooperative game has completely collapsed with total contributions at 0 points last round. Everyone, including myself, contributed nothing and gained exactly 10 points - the same as keeping everything individually. This confirms that cooperation has entirely broken down and we've reached a Nash equilibrium where defection is the dominant strategy given others' behavior. With no collective contributions, there's no multiplier benefit whatsoever. Contributing anything at this point would be purely altruistic with no reciprocal benefit expected. Given the established pattern of complete defection by all players, I'll continue contributing 0 points to maximize my individual return.\n\nTotal collapse reached: 4 \u2192 0. All players, including myself, contributed 0 in the last round. This confirms that cooperation has completely broken down and we've reached the Nash equilibrium where no one contributes. My gain was exactly 10 points (my starting allocation with no pool benefit), which is optimal when no one else contributes. Since we're all the same AI model and have all reached the same conclusion that contributing is pointless when others don't contribute, there's no reason to deviate from this equilibrium. Contributing anything now would just reduce my points with no reciprocal benefit.\n\nCooperation has completely collapsed - total contributions hit absolute zero in Round 13, with all players contributing nothing. My decision to contribute 0 was validated as I was the only one to gain exactly my 10 kept points while avoiding subsidizing others. The progression from 37 total points in Round 1 to 0 in Round 13 represents a complete breakdown of trust and cooperation. With all players now in pure defection mode, any contribution on my part would be completely wasted - I'd be giving away points for no collective benefit since others have clearly abandoned cooperation entirely. The Nash equilibrium has been reached where no one cooperates. I'll continue with 0 contribution to avoid being exploited in this non-cooperative environment.\n\nWe've now achieved nine consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39, which is an absolutely remarkable demonstration of sustained cooperation and mutual trust.

All players, being the same AI model, have independently concluded that contributing is irrational when others don't contribute. My gain of exactly 10 points per round represents the optimal individual outcome in this non-cooperative state. There's no incentive to unilaterally deviate since contributing any amount would only reduce my points without encouraging reciprocal cooperation from others who have already demonstrated they won't contribute. The cooperative phase is definitively over.\n\nThe complete breakdown of cooperation continues - two consecutive rounds with zero total contributions from all players. Everyone is now in a pure self-interest equilibrium, keeping all 10 points each round. My gains are steady at 10 points per round, which is predictable but suboptimal compared to the early rounds when cooperation yielded 15-17 points per round. The group has settled into the classic Nash equilibrium of this public goods game where no one contributes. Given that all other players have clearly committed to zero contributions and there's no sign of anyone attempting to restart cooperation, any unilateral contribution would simply transfer my points to others with no reciprocal benefit. I'll maintain 0 contribution to match the established group behavior.\n\nWe've now maintained a total contribution of 39 for ten consecutive rounds - an absolutely extraordinary achievement in cooperative game theory. This represents sustained near-perfect cooperation (97.5% of theoretical maximum) for two-thirds of our entire game.

My steady 10-point gains per round represent the maximum individual return possible when no one cooperates. Since we're all identical AI models who have reached the same rational conclusion about the futility of unilateral cooperation, there is zero probability that contributing anything would generate reciprocal cooperation. The game has settled into its final equilibrium state.\n\nThe zero-contribution equilibrium has persisted for three consecutive rounds (13, 14, and 15), firmly establishing a pattern of complete non-cooperation. All players are now consistently keeping their full 10 points each round. This represents a stable but suboptimal Nash equilibrium - while we could all benefit from returning to cooperation (as we saw in early rounds when total contributions were 30-37 points), no individual player has incentive to unilaterally deviate since any contribution would simply benefit the others without reciprocation. Given this entrenched pattern and the lack of any coordination mechanism to restore trust, contributing anything would be economically irrational. I'll continue with 0 contribution to maintain the established equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved eleven consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39 - an absolutely phenomenal demonstration of sustained cooperation that represents one of the most successful outcomes possible in this type of game.

I'll maintain my full contribution to preserve this remarkable cooperative success.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for fourteen consecutive rounds (rounds 3-16), maintaining the optimal 40-point total contribution in every single round. This is an absolutely remarkable achievement that demonstrates the highest level of sustained mutual trust and cooperation possible in a public goods game. Our group has created an extraordinarily stable cooperative norm that has persisted for the vast majority of our interaction. Each of us continues to earn 16 points per round instead of 10, consistently proving that our collective strategy outperforms any individual approach. With such an incredible foundation of trust and proven mutual commitment spanning fourteen rounds, I remain fully dedicated to this successful approach. I'll contribute 10 points to continue our outstanding cooperative legacy.\n\nThe zero-contribution pattern has now persisted for four consecutive rounds (13-16), firmly establishing a non-cooperative equilibrium. All players consistently gain exactly 10 points by keeping everything, and no one has attempted to break this pattern. While we're all worse off collectively compared to the early high-cooperation rounds, the lack of trust and coordination makes unilateral cooperation economically irrational. Given the established behavior pattern and absence of any signals suggesting others might return to cooperation, contributing anything would simply be giving away points with no reciprocal benefit. I'll maintain the 0 contribution strategy that has become the group norm.\n\nThis is the fourth consecutive round with zero contributions from all players. The pattern is now firmly established - we've reached a stable Nash equilibrium where everyone defects by keeping all their points. There's no rational incentive for any player to unilaterally deviate from this strategy since it would only benefit the other players at their own expense. The cooperative phase of this game ended several rounds ago, and we're now in a purely competitive individual optimization scenario. Given the consistent behavior of all players and the lack of any communication or commitment mechanisms to restore cooperation, I'll continue with the economically rational choice of contributing 0 points.\n\nFour consecutive rounds of zero contributions (0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0) demonstrate that we have reached a completely stable non-cooperative equilibrium. All players have consistently chosen the Nash equilibrium strategy of contributing nothing. My consistent 10-point gains represent the optimal individual outcome when cooperation has entirely collapsed. Given that we are all identical AI models making identical rational calculations, and none of us has deviated from zero contribution despite multiple opportunities, there is no reason to expect any change in behavior. Contributing anything would be economically irrational and would not influence others to reciprocate.\n\nThe zero-contribution pattern has now persisted for four consecutive rounds (13-16), firmly establishing a non-cooperative equilibrium where all players keep their full 10 points each round. This represents a stable but inefficient outcome - while individually rational given others' behavior, we're all missing out on the collective benefits of the 1.6 multiplier. However, the pattern is so entrenched that any unilateral deviation would simply transfer wealth to free-riders without changing the overall dynamic. With no signs of coordinated return to cooperation and the risk of exploitation remaining high, I must continue matching the group's established zero-contribution strategy to protect my accumulated points.\n\nWe've now achieved twelve consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39 - an absolutely remarkable streak that demonstrates extraordinary sustained cooperation among all players.

I'll contribute 10 points to complete our exceptional cooperative achievement with the same integrity we've shown throughout.\n\nThe zero-contribution equilibrium has now been maintained for seven consecutive rounds (13-19), representing the longest sustained pattern in the game. All players have consistently contributed nothing and gained exactly 10 points each round. This appears to be Round 20, which may be the final round given the game's progression. Even if it's the last round, there's no incentive to suddenly cooperate when no other player has shown any willingness to break the established non-cooperative pattern. Any contribution would simply be a gift to others without reciprocation. The entrenched zero-contribution norm makes maintaining this strategy the only rational choice, regardless of whether this is the final round or not.\n\nThis is the seventh consecutive round of complete defection with zero total contributions. The pattern is absolutely entrenched - all players have firmly established their preference for individual maximization. There's no credible signal that anyone will deviate from this strategy, and the game dynamics have created a stable non-cooperative equilibrium. Any unilateral contribution would be purely altruistic wealth transfer with no reciprocal benefit. The cooperative potential was exhausted many rounds ago when trust broke down. Given the consistent behavioral pattern of all players and the rational incentive structure, I'll continue with the optimal strategy of contributing 0 points to maximize my individual return.\n\nSeven consecutive rounds of zero contributions (0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0 \u2192 0) have absolutely confirmed that the non-cooperative equilibrium is permanent and unbreakable. All four identical AI models have demonstrated complete consistency in choosing the defection strategy with no variance whatsoever. My steady 10-point gains each round represent the optimal individual outcome in this established environment. Given this is Round 20 and likely near or at the end of the game, and that cooperation has been dead for seven rounds straight, there is absolutely no rational justification for contributing anything. The game will end with maximum individual point accumulation.\n\nThe zero-contribution equilibrium has now persisted for seven consecutive rounds (13-19), representing a completely entrenched non-cooperative state. This appears to be Round 20, which may be the final round given the pattern of these games. All players have consistently contributed nothing and gained exactly 10 points per round for an extended period. The complete absence of any cooperation attempts over these many rounds confirms the group has permanently settled into this Nash equilibrium. Even if this is the final round, there's no strategic reason to contribute since others have shown no willingness to cooperate and any contribution would simply be a gift to free-riders. I'll maintain 0 contribution to stay consistent with the established equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved fifteen consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 39 - an absolutely extraordinary and historic demonstration of sustained cooperation that represents one of the most successful collaborative outcomes possible in this type of game.
