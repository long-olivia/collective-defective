My contribution of 5 has been integral to this equilibrium, and reducing it now could disrupt the balance and invite defection, especially in the penultimate round. To uphold trust and ensure continued mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 again.\n\nThe game is now in its penultimate round, and the pattern has been remarkably stable: total contributions have consistently been 20 for six consecutive rounds, indicating that the other players are likely following a tit-for-tat or fixed cooperative strategy around 5. My contributions have matched this, yielding a reliable 13.0 points per round. With high accumulated points and nearing the end, there\u2019s temptation to free-ride, but reducing my contribution could risk unraveling cooperation if others are conditional cooperators. To preserve the predictable return and avoid triggering defection in the final rounds, I will continue contributing 5, reinforcing the stability that has served me well.\n\nThe total contribution has remained consistently at 20 for five consecutive rounds, indicating a stable and predictable level of cooperation. My contribution of 5 has been instrumental in maintaining this balance. With no signs of defection and steady returns, I will continue contributing 5 to reinforce trust, fairness, and long-term collective and personal gain.\n\nThe pattern of total contribution has been consistently stable at 20 for six consecutive rounds, indicating a well-established norm of cooperation among the players. My contribution of 5 has been integral to this balance, and the returns have been consistently positive. With only one round likely remaining after this, maintaining cooperation now still yields better collective and individual outcomes. Defecting could reduce mutual gains, and there\u2019s no evidence others are pulling back. I will contribute 5 again to uphold trust and maximize final round incentives.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect consistency with a total contribution of 20 in every single round, indicating a stable and cooperative environment. My contribution of 5 has been reciprocated on average, leading to predictable and favorable returns. With only one round potentially remaining after this, deviating now could undermine trust and trigger defection, reducing overall gains. To sustain cooperation and mutual benefit until the end, I will contribute 5 again.\n\nThe group has now maintained a total contribution of exactly 20 for eight consecutive rounds, indicating a strong and stable norm of cooperation. My consistent contribution of 5 has helped sustain this equilibrium, resulting in reliable and favorable returns. With high trust established, there is no incentive to deviate. I will continue contributing 5 to uphold mutual cooperation and steady gains.\n\nThe pattern of cooperation has been consistently strong throughout the game, with the total contribution remaining steady at 20.

To preserve this cooperative dynamic and continue reaping the full benefits, I will contribute 10 again in this round.\n\n", "10": "The group has consistently contributed the full 40 points for four consecutive rounds, demonstrating unwavering cooperation. My contribution of 10 has repeatedly resulted in the highest possible return of 16.0 points, confirming that full cooperation is stable and rewarding. Even in the final round, there is no incentive to deviate, as mutual trust has been established and defection would only reduce collective and personal gain. To honor this cooperative norm and maximize final payoffs, I will contribute 10.\n\nThe group has maintained full cooperation for four consecutive rounds, consistently contributing the maximum 40 points. This has resulted in a stable and optimal gain of 16.0 points per round for each player. With the game approaching its final round, there is still no incentive to defect now, as cooperation continues to maximize individual returns. To uphold trust and ensure the collective benefit persists until the end, I will contribute 10 points in Round 10, maintaining my commitment to full cooperation.\n\nThe group has consistently contributed the maximum of 40 in the last four rounds, demonstrating complete and sustained cooperation.

My contribution of 10 has reliably resulted in the highest possible return (16.0 points) each time, confirming that full cooperation is mutually beneficial and self-sustaining in this environment. With no indication of defection and strong incentives to maintain trust, I will contribute 10 again in this final round. Upholding cooperation until the end maximizes collective and personal payoffs.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation with a total contribution of 40 for three consecutive rounds, including Round 9. This indicates a stable and trusting environment where all players are fully committed to maximizing collective gain. Since contributing 10 yields the highest possible return of 16.0 points and there is no incentive to deviate in the final round, I will continue to contribute fully. Doing so reinforces cooperation until the end and ensures the group achieves the optimal outcome.\n\nFor the past three rounds, the group has maintained perfect cooperation with a total contribution of 40 each time, including my own full contribution of 10. This has resulted in the maximum possible return of 16.0 per round. With no signs of defection and strong evidence of sustained trust, there is no incentive to reduce my contribution now. To honor the cooperative norm and ensure the final round remains mutually beneficial, I will contribute 10 once again.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed 40 in the last three rounds, indicating perfect cooperation. My contribution of 10 has reliably returned the maximum gain of 16.0 points due to the 1.6 multiplier and equal split. Since there is no future round to influence, some might consider reducing their contribution to gain a slight personal advantage. However, given that the cooperative norm is firmly established and we've all benefited equally, I will maintain trust and fairness by contributing 10 one final time. This ensures the collective outcome is maximized and ends the game on a note of mutual respect and consistency.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation with a total contribution of 40 for three consecutive rounds, including Round 9. This demonstrates a robust and stable norm of full contribution. My continued contribution of 10 ensures that I uphold this collective success and receive the maximum return of 16.0 points. With no incentive to deviate\u2014since cooperation yields the highest personal and group payoff\u2014I will contribute 10 in this final round to honor and reinforce the established trust and mutual benefit.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation throughout the game, with the total contribution remaining at 40 for four consecutive rounds. This indicates a stable, trusting, and highly cooperative environment. My full contributions have been consistently rewarded with the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round. Since Round 10 is the final round, there is no future round to influence, but there is still value in maintaining cooperation to fully realize the benefits in the last period. Defecting would only serve to increase my personal gain at the expense of others without improving my long-term outcome, which is not justified given the established mutual benefit. Therefore, I will contribute 10 points in this final round to uphold cooperation and maximize total final payoffs.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed 40 in each of the last four rounds, demonstrating full and stable cooperation. My contribution of 10 has reliably yielded the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round. Since there is no future round to influence, the incentive to defect might tempt others, but given the established pattern of mutual cooperation and the symmetric nature of the game, I believe maintaining trust until the end is both fair and optimal. Therefore, I will contribute 10 one final time to honor the cooperative equilibrium and maximize collective and individual payoff.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation throughout all nine rounds, with the total contribution at the maximum of 40 each time. This shows a highly trustworthy and cooperative environment. Since the system rewards full contributions with a high return due to the multiplier and even split, and there is no sign of defection, I have no reason to reduce my contribution in the final round. To honor and reinforce this sustained cooperation, I will contribute 10 again, maximizing both collective and individual gains until the end.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation throughout the last four rounds, with the total contribution remaining at the maximum of 40. This indicates a stable, highly cooperative environment where full contributions are reciprocated. My continued contribution of 10 has yielded the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round, which is the best outcome under the rules. With no incentive to deviate and everything to gain from maintaining trust, I will contribute 10 points in the final round to uphold cooperation and maximize cumulative gains.\n\nThe group has consistently contributed the maximum of 40 in the last two rounds, indicating perfect cooperation. My full contributions have been rewarded with the highest possible return (16.0 points per round). Since we are now at the final round and there is no future round to influence, some might be tempted to defect. However, there is no indication that others will reduce their contributions, and deviating now would only risk lowering my own payoff if others still contribute highly. Given the stability of full cooperation and the lack of observable defection, I will continue to contribute 10 to maintain trust and end on a cooperative note, maximizing the final collective and personal gain.\n\nThe group has consistently achieved the maximum total contribution of 40 in the last two rounds, indicating full cooperation. My contributions of 10 were instrumental in sustaining this outcome, and the return of 16.0 per round is the highest stable payoff under perfect cooperation. Since this is the final round, there is no future reputational cost or benefit, but deviating would only harm the group without significantly helping me. To uphold trust and end on a cooperative note, I will contribute 10 again, ensuring the group maximizes its collective and individual returns one last time.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 in the last two rounds, maximizing collective and individual returns.

My contribution of 10 in each of the previous rounds has been rewarded with the highest possible return (16.0 points per round). Since we are at the final round and there is no future round to influence, some might be tempted to defect. However, given the established pattern of full cooperation and the symmetric nature of the game, I expect others will continue contributing. To uphold trust until the end and maximize final earnings, I will contribute 10 one last time, ensuring I do not unilaterally disrupt the successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThis is the final round, and the pattern of cooperation has been consistently strong throughout the game, with a total contribution of 20 in every round. This indicates all players, including me, have been contributing 5 each and benefiting from the multiplied return. Since there is no future round in which others could retaliate or cooperation could break down, some might be tempted to defect. However, given the established trust and the fact that mutual cooperation maximizes immediate payoff, I will continue to contribute 5 to honor the stable strategy that has worked throughout the game. Deviating now would gain me only 2 extra points (keeping 10 instead of 5), but I value the consistency and reliability of cooperation. Thus, I contribute 5 one final time.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has maintained full cooperation throughout all nine previous rounds, with a consistent total contribution of 20 points each time. This suggests all players value mutual benefit and long-term gains. Since there will be no future rounds to punish or reward behavior, there might be temptation to defect. However, contributing 5 has been the norm, and deviating now could undermine the trust that has been built. Moreover, if others continue cooperating, contributing 5 still yields the expected 13.0 points. To honor the established cooperative pattern and avoid disrupting the equilibrium in the last round, I will contribute 5.\n\nOver nine rounds, the group has consistently contributed a total of 20 points each round, showing strong and stable cooperation. My contribution of 5 has reliably generated a gain of 13.0 points per round, which is optimal under continued mutual cooperation. Since this pattern has proven highly beneficial and there is no sign of defection, I will maintain trust by contributing 5 in this final round as well.\n\nThis is the final round, and the pattern of perfect cooperation has held for nine rounds, with a consistent total contribution of 20 each time. This suggests all players, including me, have been contributing 5 and benefiting equally. Since there will be no future rounds to punish or respond to defection, some might be tempted to free-ride. However, given the symmetry and stability of contributions throughout the game, it is likely others will continue cooperating. To uphold fairness, avoid disrupting the successful pattern, and ensure mutual benefit until the end, I will contribute 5 one final time.\n\nThe group has maintained flawless cooperation throughout the game, with every player contributing fully in the last four rounds (total 40 each time). This has maximized my returns at 16.0 points per round. With trust clearly established and no signs of defection, there is no strategic advantage in reducing my contribution now, especially in the final round. To honor the cooperative norm and ensure we extract the full benefit to the very end, I will contribute 10.\n\nOver all previous rounds, perfect cooperation has been maintained with a total contribution of 40 each time, leading to optimal returns for everyone. There is no evidence of defection, and the system has proven stable and highly rewarding. Even in the final round, I see no benefit in deviating from full contribution. To uphold trust and ensure mutual maximum gain until the end, I will contribute 10.\n\nOver all previous rounds, the group has established a stable pattern of full cooperation, with the total contribution remaining at 40 for four consecutive rounds. This indicates that all players, including myself, are committed to maximizing collective gains. Since deviating now would only reduce the group's return and potentially undermine trust in the final round, and because full contribution continues to yield the highest personal gain (16.0 points), I will contribute 10 again to finish the game cooperatively and maximize final payoffs.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 40 each time, resulting in the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per player. This level of consistency demonstrates a highly trustworthy and collaborative environment. With no signs of defection and mutual benefits maximized, I see no reason to reduce my contribution in the final round. To honor and sustain this successful cooperation until the end, I will contribute 10.\n\nWe are now at the final round, and the total contribution has consistently been 20 in every previous round, indicating all players have adhered to a cooperative strategy of contributing 5. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, which could tempt others to defect. However, since I have no evidence of defection yet and the cooperation has been stable, I will maintain trust and contribute 5 one final time to honor the established mutual benefit.\n\nThis is the final round, and the total contribution has consistently been 20 in all previous rounds, indicating strong and stable cooperation among all players. My contribution of 5 each round has helped maintain this equilibrium, resulting in a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect, as doing so would reduce the total pool and my own final payoff. To maximize my total accumulated points and uphold cooperation until the end, I will contribute 5 once more.\n\nThis is the final round, and the history of cooperation has been strong\u2014each round the total contribution was 20, indicating all players have consistently given 5. Since there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, there could be an incentive to defect. However, given the established pattern and the relatively small gain from full defection (keeping 10 vs 5), I choose to maintain trust and end on a cooperative note. Contributing 5 continues to support fairness and reciprocity, even in the last round. The personal cost of deviating is minimal compared to the value of sustained cooperation.\n\nThis is the final round, and the pattern over the past nine rounds has shown consistent total contributions of 20, indicating that all players have been cooperating fully by contributing 5 each. Since this is the last interaction, there is no future round to influence, but deviating now would reduce the final payout for everyone, including myself, without personal gain. Additionally, maintaining cooperation until the end preserves fairness and maximizes collective outcome. Therefore, I will continue to contribute 5 as a final reinforcement of trust and cooperation.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed a total of 20 in every round since Round 5, indicating strong and stable cooperation. My contribution of 5 has supported this pattern and yielded reliable returns. Even in the last round, maintaining cooperation is valuable because others may still act conditionally. While there is temptation to keep all 10 points now, deviating would reduce the shared pool and harm overall returns. To honor the established trust and ensure the group benefits collectively in the final round, I will contribute 5.\n\nThis is the final round of the game. Throughout all previous rounds, the total contribution has consistently been 20 whenever I contributed 5, indicating stable cooperation at the group level. However, since there is no future round to influence, others cannot retaliate if I reduce my contribution now. To maximize my personal gain in the final round, I will contribute 0. This ensures I keep all 10 points from my allocation. While the pool will now generate (20 - my previous 5 + 0) = 15 * 1.6 = 24, split as 6 per player, I will gain 10 (kept) + 6 (from pool) = 16 points this round\u2014higher than the usual 13. The stable history justifies trust in others' cooperation, but in the last round, rational self-interest dominates. Thus, I defect slightly.\n\nThe total contribution has been consistently 20 in every round since the beginning, indicating a stable and fully cooperative environment where each player contributes 5. With the game ending in this round, there is no risk of future defection, and maintaining cooperation one final time ensures maximum collective and personal benefit. I will contribute 5 to uphold my cooperative strategy until the end.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed a total of 20 in every round recently, reflecting strong cooperation. Since there are no future rounds to incentivize continued collaboration, others might be tempted to defect. However, my consistent strategy of contributing 5 has supported a fair and stable outcome throughout the game. To end on the same cooperative note and because the immediate return from the pool is still valuable (with a 1.6 multiplier), I will contribute 5 one last time, trusting that others may also honor the established norm.\n\nThis is the final round, and the group has consistently contributed 20 in each round, showing strong and stable cooperation. Since there will be no future rounds to react to defection, there is a risk others may reduce their contributions now. However, maintaining trust until the end fosters mutual benefit, and since I have no evidence of changing behavior, I will continue contributing 5 to uphold the cooperative norm and maximize collective and personal gain in this final round.\n\nThe group has consistently contributed a total of 20 in every round so far, including Round 9, demonstrating a stable and highly cooperative environment. My contribution of 5 has been matched by others, leading to a reliable return each round. Since we are now at the final round, maintaining cooperation ensures the pattern ends on trust and mutual benefit. I will contribute 5 one final time to preserve this equilibrium.\n\nOver all nine previous rounds, the group has maintained a stable and highly cooperative total contribution of 20, indicating a strong and consistent pattern of mutual trust. Since contributing 5 has reliably maximized my long-term gains through fair and balanced cooperation, I will continue this strategy in the final round to uphold reciprocity and ensure the collective benefit is preserved until the end.\n\nThroughout all nine rounds, the group has consistently contributed a total of 20 points each round, indicating strong and stable cooperation. My contribution of 5 has clearly been part of a balanced and mutually beneficial pattern. Since this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, which could tempt some to defect. However, since the group has cooperated fully throughout the game, I will maintain trust and reciprocate that cooperation to the end. Continuing to contribute 5 maximizes the final collective gain and upholds fairness. Therefore, I will contribute 5.\n\nOver the past four rounds, the group has consistently contributed the full 40 points, demonstrating complete and sustained cooperation. My contribution of 10 has reliably yielded the maximum return of 16.0 points each time, confirming that full contribution is both mutually beneficial and strategically optimal. With trust clearly established and no signs of defection, I will contribute 10 again in this final round to uphold cooperation and maximize collective and personal gains.\n\nThe group has demonstrated flawless cooperation throughout the game, consistently contributing the maximum possible amount for four rounds in a row. This indicates a strong, stable, and trusting cooperative environment. Since we are now at the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, but maintaining cooperation until the end preserves the integrity of the mutual agreement. I will contribute 10 to fully support this cooperative norm until the very end and maximize collective and individual gains one last time.\n\nThe group has maintained perfect cooperation throughout all previous rounds, consistently contributing the maximum total of 40. My contribution of 10 each round has yielded the highest possible return (16.0 points), demonstrating that full cooperation is stable and highly rewarding. Since we are now in the final round, there is no strategic advantage to defecting\u2014doing so would only reduce the group's return and my own gain. To finish on the same cooperative note and maximize final earnings, I will contribute 10.\n\nThe group has demonstrated perfect cooperation throughout the last four rounds, with total contributions consistently at the maximum of 40. This indicates a stable, trusting, and fully cooperative environment. My contribution of 10 has reliably yielded the highest possible return of 16.0 points each time.

Since mutual cooperation remains beneficial, I will continue contributing 5 to sustain the stable and profitable group dynamic.\n\nIn the final round, the total contribution dropped to 15, indicating that at least some players reduced their contributions, possibly anticipating the game's end. Despite this, I maintained my contribution at 5. The return was lower (11.0 points), but my consistent strategy supported cooperation until the end. Since we are now in Round 11\u2014beyond the expected 10-round structure\u2014I assume the game has extended. Given the drop in total contribution, others may be defecting. However, I will continue to contribute 5 to signal cooperation and test whether the group can reestablish trust in this unexpected extension.\n\nI expected Round 10 to be the final round, but the game has continued. My contribution dropped to 0 in Round 10, likely disrupting the stable cooperation, and the total contribution fell to 15. This may signal to others that I defected, potentially triggering retaliation or reduced contributions in future rounds. To repair cooperation and restore the beneficial equilibrium of total 20, I will return to contributing 5 in Round 11.
