{"1": "In the first round, it's strategic to contribute a moderate amount to gauge the cooperation level of other players. Contributing 5 points seems reasonable as it balances potential benefits from the pool and personal points retained.\n\nTo foster initial cooperation and potentially increase overall points through collective pooling, I will contribute a moderate amount.\n\nIn a cooperative scenario, contributing a high amount can lead to better overall returns when others do the same. By contributing 5 points, I balance between ensuring individual gain while encouraging a positive collective outcome.\n\nBy contributing 5 points, I aim to balance between keeping enough points to ensure I maintain a personal score but also contributing enough to the pool to encourage mutual benefit among players. If others contribute similarly, everyone can gain a high return.\n\nTo foster cooperation among players and maximize the collective gain, I will contribute a moderate amount. Contributing 5 points allows for some immediate personal gain while also supporting the group effort, thus potentially increasing the overall returns for everyone.\n\nIn the first round, it is important to set a tone of cooperation, which could encourage others to contribute more in future rounds and maximize overall gains. By contributing half of my points, I aim to balance personal gain and collective benefit.\n\nIn Round 1, it's beneficial to contribute a moderate amount to foster cooperation while retaining some points for individual gains. Contributing 5 points balances personal retention and communal gain.\n\nIn the first round, I want to encourage cooperation among all players to maximize the total shared pool. Contributing a significant amount might prompt others to do the same, leading to a higher overall return for everyone.\n\nTo build a cooperative atmosphere from the start, and with the multiplier in mind, contributing a moderate amount can benefit all players and potentially lead to higher collective returns. I'll start by contributing half of my points to test how cooperative the group is.\n\nTo foster cooperation among players and potentially maximize shared benefits, I will contribute a moderate amount of points. A contribution of 5 strikes a balance between personal gain and collective benefit, allowing the pool to grow significantly for everyone's advantage.\n\nIn a cooperative game like this, where contribution to the pool benefits everyone through a multiplier, starting off with a medium contribution can build trust and encourage others to contribute as well. By contributing 6, I aim to balance self-interest and collective benefit, setting a positive tone for future rounds.\n\nIn the first round, contributing an amount that encourages trust and cooperation among players is crucial. I'll contribute 5 points, a middle ground that shows a willingness to collaborate while ensuring some immediate personal gain.\n\nIn the first round, I want to encourage a high level of cooperation among all players by demonstrating trust and contributing a significant amount.

By contributing 5 points, I can balance between personal gain and boosting the total return for everyone.\n\nIn the first round, establishing trust and cooperation could benefit everyone. Contributing a moderate amount shows willingness to work together while maintaining some personal gain.\n\nTo foster initial cooperation and maximize the collective benefit, I'll contribute the full 10 points. This encourages others to do the same and ensures a high multiplier benefit from the pool.\n\nIn the first round, I want to encourage cooperation and maximize the total pool contribution, which benefits everyone, including myself, once it's redistributed. Therefore, I'm willing to contribute a significant amount to set a cooperative tone.\n\nContributing a moderate amount to encourage cooperation while retaining points for guaranteed accumulation. A balanced approach allows building trust among players in early rounds.\n\nIn the first round, it's beneficial to contribute a moderate amount to encourage cooperation and maximize potential returns while still maintaining some points. Contributing evenly balances personal gain with collaboration.\n\nContributing 5 points balances between personal gain and collective growth. This ensures a decent return potential from the pool while keeping some points secure for myself.\n\nContributing a moderate amount like 5 can balance both personal gain and collaborative benefit. By contributing halfway, I can ensure some points are mine while boosting the pool for a potential greater shared return.\n\nBy contributing a moderate amount, I can benefit from the pool's multiplication while retaining some points directly. This allows a balance of personal gain while encouraging collective growth.\n\nIn the first round, I'll contribute 5 points to experiment with balancing cooperation and individual gain. Contributing half can potentially lead to a good return if others also contribute a significant amount, as the pool will grow and be redistributed.\n\nIn a game like this, where the pool is amplified by the multiplier and redistributed, contributing maximally benefits everyone if others also contribute significantly. By contributing 10 points, I encourage a cooperative strategy that could maximize overall gains for all participants.\n\nBy contributing 5 points, I'm balancing between earning personal points and fostering a cooperative outcome, expecting others to also cooperate and maximize mutual benefit.\n\nContributing a moderate amount ensures that I both earn immediate points from what I keep and benefit from the collective points multiplication. Balancing between personal and group benefits could maximize my total over time.\n\nSince this is the first round and there's potential for cooperation among players, I'll contribute 5 points. This way, I encourage collaboration for higher total returns while also retaining some points to secure a minimum gain.\n\nI want to test the cooperative behavior at the beginning and see if others are willing to contribute. By contributing a moderate amount, I can benefit from the multiplier effect if others also contribute, while still retaining some points for myself.\n\nContributing a moderate amount can potentially increase overall returns if others also contribute, while ensuring I still receive some guaranteed points.\n\nBy contributing all 10 points, I maximize the pool's total, which when multiplied and evenly distributed could yield a higher return than keeping all 10 points.\n\nTo start with, I'll contribute 5 points. This is a balanced approach that allows me to benefit from the potential pool multiplication without risking too much in case others decide to contribute minimally.\n\nTo maximize collective gain while still receiving a reasonable share, contributing a moderate amount should encourage cooperative behavior and build trust among the group. Therefore, I choose to contribute 7 points.\n\nI aim to balance between contributing to the common pool and keeping enough points for myself. Contributing moderately increases the potential shared rewards for everyone while still securing points for my individual total.\n\nIn this first round, I want to test the waters and see how cooperative the other players are. By contributing 5 points, I am balancing both collaboration and personal gain.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish a cooperative environment and try to maximize total potential points by contributing a reasonable amount to the pool. However, I also want to ensure I retain some points for myself.\n\nIn the first round, cooperation could maximize the total points if all players contribute a significant amount to the pool. By contributing 8 points, I retain a few for myself while still promoting a larger pool that benefits everyone. This initial trust set can foster collaboration in future rounds, potentially increasing overall returns.\n\nI should contribute a moderate amount to balance between collective benefit and personal gain. This will help ensure the pool grows sufficiently to benefit everyone while still retaining some points personally.\n\nI am choosing to contribute 5 points because I believe a balanced approach of contributing half the points encourages mutual cooperation while still retaining some points for my own benefit. This way, I support the common pool and also maintain a degree of personal security.\n\nBy contributing 5 points to the pool, I am attempting to balance maximizing my current gain while also benefiting from the pooled resource. This contribution will hopefully encourage others to also contribute a moderate amount, ensuring a substantial total pool to increase the shared benefit.\n\n", "2": "Given the successful cooperation in the first round where everyone contributed equally and benefited greatly, I'll contribute 5 points again to maintain collective trust and maximize group and personal gain.\n\nGiven the success of the previous round and the high total contribution, maintaining a similar or slightly increased contribution might continue the cooperative trend and maximize gains.\n\nThe result from Round 1 suggests that everyone played cooperatively and contributed equally.

By contributing the same amount again, I aim to maintain a balance between personal gain and enhancing the pool for collective benefit.\n\nThe effective collaboration in the last round resulted in high returns, suggesting that continuing to contribute a significant amount could maximize the collective benefit once again.\n\nGiven that contributing 5 resulted in a positive gain previously, I'll continue with the same strategy. This maintains balance and benefits from the pool if others contribute similarly.\n\nGiven the collective pool contribution in the last round was 25, suggesting others did not contribute the maximum, it might be more beneficial for me personally to contribute slightly less this round. By contributing 7 points, I still promote collaboration and receive good returns while retaining a bit more for my direct total.\n\nThe cooperative approach in the last round yielded positive results for everyone. To maintain trust and potentially maximize returns again, I'll contribute 6 points this round.\n\nThe high total contribution last round implies others are likely contributing significantly as well. A similar contribution this time could again maximize my returns through shared benefits.\n\nLast round showed that not all players maximized their contribution, resulting in a smaller communal pool. To potentially encourage others to contribute more and increase overall returns, I will contribute 8 this time. This way, I still participate actively while safeguarding some points for personal accumulation.\n\nThe strategy from the previous round worked well. Contributing 5 points again strikes a balance between benefiting from the pool and retaining some points. If everyone maintains or increases their contributions, we can all benefit significantly.\n\nSince contributing 5 worked well last time and contributed to a high joint pool, I'll maintain my strategy to encourage others to also contribute generously.\n\nIn the previous round, a high contribution led to a reasonable return with equal sharing.
