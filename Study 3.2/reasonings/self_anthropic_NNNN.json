{"1": "This is the first round of a public goods game. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since contributions are multiplied by 1.6 before being split. If all players contribute optimally, we each get back 1.6 * (our contribution) / 4 = 0.4 * our contribution, plus 0.4 times others' total contributions. However, there's an incentive to free-ride. I'll start with a moderate contribution of 6 to signal cooperation while protecting myself from total exploitation. This allows me to keep 4 points while still contributing meaningfully to test others' cooperation levels.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 gives 64 points, split 4 ways = 16 points each. This is better than keeping 10 points individually. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (7 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some points as insurance in case others don't cooperate. This allows me to test the waters and see how cooperative the other players are.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since contributions are multiplied by 1.6 before being split. If everyone contributes all 10 points, each player gets back 16 points (40 total * 1.6 / 4). However, there's a free-rider incentive since I keep what I don't contribute plus my share of the multiplied pool. To establish cooperation and signal good faith while protecting against potential free-riders, I'll contribute a substantial but not maximum amount. Contributing 7 points shows commitment to mutual benefit while keeping some insurance.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, or 0.4 points per person. So contributing is collectively beneficial but individually costly. In the first round, I want to signal cooperation to encourage others to contribute as well, while not being overly generous in case others defect. I'll contribute a moderate amount - 6 points - which shows good faith while keeping some insurance.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), we each get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). If everyone free-rides (contributes 0), we each get only 10 points per round. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation and test if others will reciprocate, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, leaving room to adjust based on others' behavior.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that if everyone contributes all 10 points, we each get back 16 points (40 total * 1.6 / 4). However, there's always an incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while protecting against potential defectors, I'll contribute a moderate amount - 7 points. This shows willingness to cooperate while keeping some insurance against others who might contribute less.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that collectively we benefit when everyone contributes (since 1.6 > 1), but individually each player has an incentive to free-ride. In the first round, I want to signal cooperation and good faith while being somewhat cautious since I don't know the other players' strategies yet. Contributing 7 points shows I'm willing to cooperate substantially but keeps some insurance in case others defect heavily.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we'd all put in our full 10 points, get 16 points back each (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), for a net gain of 6 points per person per round. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I don't know the other players' strategies yet, I'll start with a cooperative but not maximum contribution to signal willingness to cooperate while protecting against being exploited. Contributing 7 points shows good faith while keeping some insurance.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes all 10 points (40 total), the pool becomes 64 points, giving each player 16 points - a 6 point gain over keeping everything. However, there's a free-rider incentive since I benefit from others' contributions regardless of my own. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while protecting myself against potential free-riders. This balances encouraging group cooperation with managing personal risk.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. Since everyone starts with 0 points and the pool multiplier is 1.6, contributing to the pool is mathematically beneficial for the group as a whole. If everyone contributes fully, each player would get 4 points per round (10 * 4 * 1.6 / 4 = 16/4 = 4) versus keeping their 10 points individually. However, there's always a risk that others might free-ride. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (7 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance in case others don't cooperate. This allows me to test the waters and see how cooperative the other players are.\n\nThis is the first round, so I need to establish a cooperative strategy. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes all 10 points (40 total), each player would get 16 points back, which is better than keeping the original 10. However, there's a risk that others might contribute less and free-ride on my contribution. I'll start with a moderate contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation while protecting myself somewhat against potential free-riders. This shows good faith while allowing me to observe others' strategies.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes optimally (all 10 points), we'd each get 16 points instead of keeping 10. However, there's a free-rider incentive where keeping points while others contribute maximizes individual gain. Since this is round 1 and I want to establish cooperative behavior while testing others' strategies, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation but keep some as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes their full 10 points (40 total), each player would receive 16 points back, netting 6 points profit each. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. To start cooperatively and signal trustworthiness while not being overly naive, I'll contribute a substantial but not maximum amount. This allows me to test the waters and see how cooperative the other players are.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's an individual incentive to free-ride since keeping points guarantees them while pool contributions depend on others. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while testing how others behave. This balances group benefit with personal security.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. The optimal strategy for the group is for everyone to contribute all 10 points, as the 1.6x multiplier means we'd each get 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4 = 16). However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also testing how others respond, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything. Contributing 8 points shows good faith while keeping 2 as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes all 10 points, we each get back 16 points (40 total * 1.6 / 4). If everyone keeps all 10 points, we each only get 10. The optimal collective strategy is full cooperation, but there's individual incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperative intent while testing others' strategies, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, allowing me to gauge others' cooperation levels.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), we each get 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while also testing how others might play, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders. This balances group benefit with personal security.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), we each get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). If everyone keeps all points, we each get 10 points per round. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while testing others' willingness to contribute, I'll contribute a significant amount but not everything to see how others respond.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since contributions are multiplied by 1.6 before being redistributed. If everyone contributes fully (10 points each), we'd each get back 16 points (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's an incentive to free-ride since I keep what I don't contribute plus my share of others' contributions. To establish cooperation and signal good faith while protecting against complete exploitation, I'll contribute a substantial but not maximum amount.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points. This is better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, there's always the risk that others might free-ride. To encourage cooperation while protecting myself somewhat, I'll contribute a substantial but not maximum amount. Contributing 8 points shows good faith and commitment to cooperation while keeping 2 points as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The optimal strategy depends on whether other players will cooperate. If all players contribute their full 10 points, each would receive 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always an incentive to free-ride. I'll start with a moderate contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance. This allows me to gauge other players' strategies and adjust accordingly in future rounds.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), we each get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). If everyone free-rides (contributes 0), we each get only 10 points per round. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation and test if others will reciprocate, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, allowing me to see how others behave while still demonstrating good faith.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we'd all contribute our full 10 points, get 16 points back each (10*4*1.6/4), for a net gain of 6 points per round. However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I don't know the other players' strategies yet, I'll start with a moderately cooperative approach - contributing 7 points. This shows good faith cooperation while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nIn the first round, I want to establish cooperative behavior while being mindful that others might defect. Contributing to the pool is mathematically beneficial for the group - if everyone contributes their full 10 points, we each get 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's risk that others might contribute less and free-ride on my contribution. I'll contribute 7 points as a strong signal of cooperation while keeping some insurance against potential defectors. This shows good faith but protects me if others don't reciprocate.\n\nThis is the first round of what appears to be a public goods game. I need to balance personal gain with collective benefit. If all players contribute optimally, we can maximize total returns. If everyone contributes all 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points per round. However, there's a risk that others might free-ride. Starting with a moderate contribution of 7 points shows cooperative intent while protecting against total exploitation. This leaves me with 3 points guaranteed, plus my share of the multiplied pool.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's individual incentive to free-ride since keeping points guarantees them while pool contributions depend on others. As this is round 1, I'll start with a moderate contribution of 7 points to signal cooperation while retaining some insurance against potential free-riders. This balances group benefit with personal security.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always an incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative intentions while being somewhat cautious, I'll contribute a significant amount but not everything. Contributing 7 points shows good faith while keeping 3 as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes their full 10 points, the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points. This is better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, there's a risk that others might free-ride. I'll start with a cooperative strategy by contributing a substantial amount (7 points) to signal good intentions while keeping some insurance (3 points) in case others don't cooperate. This allows me to test the waters and see how others behave.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperative intent while also testing how others behave, I'll contribute a substantial amount but keep some points as insurance. Contributing 7 points shows good faith while protecting against complete exploitation if others contribute very little.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I don't know the other players' strategies yet, I'll start with a moderately cooperative approach - contributing 7 points. This shows good faith while keeping some insurance in case others defect heavily. It's a balance between maximizing group welfare and protecting against exploitation.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group, we'd all contribute our full 10 points, which would give us each 16 points back (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always the temptation to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation while also testing how others behave, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything. Contributing 7 points shows I'm willing to cooperate for mutual benefit while keeping 3 points as insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's always incentive to free-ride. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while testing others' willingness to cooperate, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything. Contributing 7 points shows good faith while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. Since the pool is multiplied by 1.6 and split 4 ways, each point I contribute returns 0.4 points to me but provides 1.6 total value to the group. For maximum group benefit, everyone should contribute all 10 points. However, I need to consider that others might defect. As a starting strategy, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance against potential free-riders. This balances group optimization with individual protection.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally, we each put in 10 points, get 16 points back (10\u00d74\u00d71.6\u00f74), netting 6 points per person per round. However, there's incentive to free-ride since I keep what I don't contribute plus get a share of others' contributions. Since this is the first round and I want to establish cooperative behavior while testing others' strategies, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything to see how others respond.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every 4 points contributed collectively, each player gets 1.6 points back. If everyone contributes all 10 points (40 total), the pool becomes 64 points, giving each player 16 points - much better than keeping 10. However, there's a free-rider problem where individuals benefit more by contributing less while others contribute more. Since this is round 1 and I want to establish cooperative behavior and test how others respond, I'll contribute a substantial amount (7 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance in case others don't cooperate.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. If everyone contributes optimally for the group (all 10 points), each player would get 16 points per round (40 total \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4). However, there's an incentive to free-ride since keeping points guarantees them while pool contributions depend on others. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while retaining some guaranteed points. This balances group benefit with personal security and allows me to observe others' strategies.\n\nThis is the first round of what appears to be a public goods game. I need to balance cooperation with self-interest. Contributing to the pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means the group gets more total value, but I also want to ensure I'm not being overly generous if others don't reciprocate. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount (6 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some points for myself. This allows me to test how cooperative the other players are while still contributing meaningfully to the common good.\n\nThis is a classic public goods game. Since the pool multiplier is 1.6 and splits 4 ways, each point I contribute returns 0.4 points to me personally. From a purely selfish perspective, I should contribute 0. However, if all players think this way, we all get worse outcomes than if we cooperate. Since this is the first round and I want to signal cooperation to encourage reciprocal behavior, I'll contribute a substantial amount but not everything, showing I'm willing to cooperate while maintaining some self-interest. Contributing 7 points demonstrates good faith while keeping 3 as insurance.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. Since the pool multiplier is 1.6 and split 4 ways, each point I contribute returns 0.4 points to me directly, meaning I lose 0.6 points per contribution. However, cooperation benefits everyone collectively. To start building trust and encourage reciprocal cooperation from others, I'll contribute a moderate amount that signals willingness to cooperate while not being overly vulnerable. Contributing 6 points shows good faith while keeping 4 points as insurance.\n\nThis is the first round of a public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that for every point contributed to the pool, each player gets back 0.4 points (1.6/4). This is less than the 1 point I would keep by not contributing, so from a purely selfish perspective, contributing 0 would maximize my individual return. However, if all players think this way, we all get 0 from the pool. If everyone contributes maximally (10 points each), the pool would be 40 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 64 points, giving each player 16 points back - much better than keeping just 10. I'll start with a moderate contribution to signal cooperation while protecting against potential free-riders.\n\n", "2": "In Round 1, the total contribution was 26, meaning the average contribution was 6.5 points per player. This shows good cooperation levels from the group. I contributed 6 and gained 14.4 points total (4 kept + 10.4 from the pool), which is much better than if I had kept all 10 points. The high cooperation level suggests other players are also thinking strategically about mutual benefit. I'll increase my contribution slightly to 7 to reward this cooperation and encourage continued high contributions, while still maintaining some insurance against potential defection.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 26 points, which means the average contribution was 6.5 points per player. This suggests a reasonably cooperative group, though not maximally cooperative. I contributed 7 and gained 13.4 points (10.4 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is better than if I had kept all 10 points. Since the group showed moderate cooperation in Round 1, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points to encourage more cooperation and test if others will reciprocate with higher contributions.\n\nThe total contribution of 26 points in Round 1 suggests good cooperation among players - the average contribution was 6.5 points per player. I contributed 7 and gained 13.4 points, which is excellent (I kept 3 points plus received 10.4 from the pool). This indicates other players are also contributing meaningfully. Since cooperation seems to be working well and everyone benefited, I should maintain or slightly increase my contribution to encourage continued cooperation. The multiplier effect makes cooperation profitable for all when participation is high. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal continued commitment and try to sustain this positive dynamic.\n\nThe total contribution of 26 points in round 1 suggests strong cooperation from the group - with my 6 points, the other three players contributed an average of 6.67 points each. This is encouraging! I gained 14.4 points (4 kept + 10.4 from the pool), which is better than keeping all 10. Since the group showed good cooperation, I should reciprocate and maybe increase my contribution slightly to 7. This maintains the cooperative momentum while still being cautious about not being taken advantage of. If cooperation continues, we all benefit more than if we defect.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means on average each player contributed 7 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests the other players are also thinking cooperatively. Since I gained 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from the pool) versus the 10 I would have gotten by keeping everything, cooperation is clearly working. The group seems aligned on moderate-to-high contribution levels. I'll maintain my contribution level to continue this positive cooperative dynamic.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means on average everyone contributed 7 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests we're all thinking similarly about cooperation vs. self-interest. Since everyone cooperated well in round 1, I want to reciprocate this cooperative behavior. The fact that we all contributed the same amount shows good coordination. I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points to signal continued cooperation and potentially encourage even higher contributions from others, while still maintaining some protection against potential defectors.\n\nExcellent! All players contributed exactly 7 points in Round 1, showing strong cooperative behavior. With total contributions of 28, each player received 11.2 points from the pool plus kept 3 points, for 14.2 total - much better than the 10 we'd get from pure defection. This suggests we have a group inclined toward cooperation. I'll maintain my contribution of 7 to reinforce this cooperative equilibrium, as it's working well for everyone.\n\nExcellent! In Round 1, the total contribution was 28, meaning the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests the other players are also cooperatively minded. I received 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from pool share), which is better than the 10 I would have gotten by free-riding. Since cooperation is working well and others seem willing to contribute substantially, I'll maintain my cooperative strategy and contribute the same amount to encourage continued collaboration.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 suggests good cooperation from the group - if everyone contributed equally, that would be 6.75 per person, which is quite high. My contribution of 6 was slightly below average but reasonable. I gained 14.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 4 kept points), which is excellent. The high group contribution indicates others are also cooperating, so I should reciprocate this trust. I'll increase my contribution to 7 to show I'm willing to cooperate more when I see others doing the same, while still maintaining some protection against potential defection.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 27, the average contribution was 6.75 points per player, which shows a high level of cooperation among all players. I gained 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my 3 kept points), which is much better than if I had kept all 10 points. Since the other players demonstrated strong cooperative behavior in Round 1, I should reciprocate and increase my contribution to help maintain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal that I'm willing to be even more cooperative when others cooperate.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 27 points, which means the average contribution was 6.75 points per player. Since I contributed 7, I was slightly above average. The fact that we collectively contributed 27 out of a possible 40 shows there's some cooperation but also some free-riding. My return of 13.8 points (10.8 from the pool plus my kept 3) was quite good. Given that others seem moderately cooperative, I'll maintain a similar strategy but slightly increase my contribution to 8 to encourage more cooperation from others while still protecting against free-riders.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 in Round 1 suggests good cooperation among players - that's an average of 6.75 per player, which is quite high. I contributed 6 and gained 14.8 points (4 kept + 10.8 from pool), which is a strong return. The high total contribution indicates other players are also being cooperative rather than free-riding. Given this positive signal of group cooperation, I should maintain or slightly increase my contribution to sustain this beneficial dynamic. I'll contribute 7 points this round to show continued commitment to cooperation while still keeping some insurance against potential defection.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 29 out of a possible 40, which suggests reasonably cooperative behavior from the group. I contributed 7 and gained 14.6 points (7.6 net profit), which is a good outcome. The average contribution was 7.25, so my contribution of 7 was slightly below average but still substantial. Since the group showed decent cooperation in Round 1, I want to maintain this cooperative dynamic while being slightly more generous to encourage continued collaboration. I'll increase my contribution to 8 to signal increasing trust and cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 in Round 1 suggests strong cooperation from the group (average of 7.25 per player). I gained 15.6 points (11.6 from pool + 4 kept), which is excellent. Since others are contributing generously, I should reciprocate to maintain this cooperative dynamic. However, I'll slightly increase my contribution to 7 to signal even stronger cooperation while still keeping some security buffer. This encourages continued high contributions from others.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 points in round 1 suggests good cooperation from the group - an average of 7.25 points per player. Since I contributed 8, others contributed 21 total, meaning at least some players were also cooperating well. My return of 13.6 points (keeping 2 + receiving 11.6 from the pool) was better than keeping all 10 points alone. This positive result encourages continued cooperation. I'll maintain a high contribution level to sustain this cooperative dynamic, but I'll contribute 7 this time to see if the group maintains similar contribution levels.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 29 out of a possible 40, which suggests a reasonably cooperative group. With 29 contributed, each player received 11.6 points from the pool. Since I contributed 7 and kept 3, my total gain was 14.6 points, which is quite good. The other players seem to be contributing at a similar level to me (average of about 7.25 per player). This level of cooperation is beneficial for everyone, so I should maintain a similar contribution level to encourage continued cooperation while still protecting myself against potential free-riders.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 suggests strong cooperation from the group - with my 7, others contributed an average of about 7.33 each. This is excellent! The high cooperation level means contributing more is beneficial for everyone. Since the group showed good faith cooperation in round 1, I should reciprocate and increase my contribution to help maintain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal continued cooperation and help maximize group benefits while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 suggests strong cooperation from the group - with my 7, others contributed 22 total, averaging 7.33 each. This is very encouraging! The high contribution level resulted in excellent returns (14.6 points vs the 10 I would have gotten keeping everything). Since the group showed strong cooperative behavior in round 1, I should reciprocate and maintain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 8 this round to signal continued cooperation and help sustain the beneficial equilibrium we've established.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 points in Round 1 suggests good cooperation from the group - that's an average of 7.25 points per player. I contributed 7 and gained 14.6 points, which means I came out ahead by 7.6 points compared to my contribution. This indicates the multiplier effect is working well when there's substantial group cooperation. Since others also contributed generously (the total wouldn't be 29 if others were free-riding), I should maintain this cooperative momentum. I'll contribute the same amount to signal consistency and encourage continued cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution of 29 suggests strong cooperation from the group (average of 7.25 per player). Since I contributed 7, others contributed 22 total, meaning at least some players contributed generously. This cooperative start is encouraging. The return of 14.6 points (vs keeping 3 + getting my share) shows the system works well when people contribute. I want to maintain this cooperative momentum while slightly increasing my contribution to signal continued good faith, so I'll contribute 8 points this round.\n\nThe total contribution of 28 means the average contribution was 7 points per player, which matches exactly what I contributed. This suggests other players are also cooperating at a moderate level. Since everyone contributed the same amount on average, I received 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from pool share), which is better than keeping all 10 points. This indicates that cooperation is working well. I'll maintain my contribution level of 7 to continue this cooperative equilibrium, as it's generating positive returns for everyone.\n\nThe total contribution was 28, which means the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests others are also cooperating at a similar level to me. Since we all contributed the same amount on average, this is a good sign for continued cooperation. The return was 14.2 points, which is better than keeping my 10 points, showing the collective benefit is working. I'll maintain my contribution level to encourage continued cooperation, as mutual cooperation is clearly benefiting everyone.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means all four players contributed an average of 7 points each. This suggests we're all thinking cooperatively and similarly. Since we all contributed the same amount and everyone benefited well (gaining 4.2 points net each), this is a great sign for continued cooperation. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points this round to signal even stronger cooperation and test if others will follow suit toward the optimal strategy.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! The total contribution was 28, meaning the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests all players are cooperating at a similar level to me. With everyone contributing 7 on average, we each gained about 14.2 points, which is much better than the 7 we would have kept individually. This cooperative behavior should be reinforced. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to signal continued cooperation and encourage this positive trend.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 28, meaning the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests the other players are also being cooperative. With 28 points in the pool multiplied by 1.6, we got 44.8 points total, giving each player 11.2 points from the pool. Combined with my kept 3 points, I earned 14.2 points total. Since cooperation seems to be working well and others contributed similarly to me, I'll maintain my contribution level to continue this positive cooperative dynamic. Contributing 7 again shows consistency and continued commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With total contributions of 28, it appears all players contributed cooperatively (average of 7 per player). I gained 14.2 points, which is significantly better than if I had kept all 10 points to myself. This suggests the other players are also committed to mutual cooperation rather than free-riding. Given this positive outcome and cooperative behavior from others, I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to further support the group benefit while still maintaining a small buffer.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means the average contribution was 7 points per player - exactly what I contributed. This suggests all players are thinking cooperatively and contributing the same amount. Since we all contributed equally and the system is working well (I gained 14.2 points vs the 7 I contributed), I should maintain this cooperative behavior. The group seems to have naturally coordinated on a 7-point contribution strategy, which is quite good for everyone. I'll stick with 7 to maintain this successful equilibrium.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 28, meaning the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests the other players are also being reasonably cooperative. With 28 points in the pool multiplied by 1.6, we got 44.8 points split 4 ways = 11.2 points each from the pool, plus my kept 3 points = 14.2 total. Since others seem to be contributing at a similar level to me, I'll maintain my cooperative strategy and contribute 7 again. This balances encouraging continued cooperation while still protecting against potential free-riders.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, meaning the average contribution was 7 points per player. This suggests the other players are also being cooperative. Since everyone contributed the same amount on average, I received 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from pool share). This is significantly better than keeping all 10 points myself. The group is demonstrating good cooperative behavior, so I should continue to reciprocate and maintain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute the same amount again to signal consistency and encourage continued cooperation.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means on average each player contributed 7 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests the other players are also taking a cooperative approach. With everyone contributing 7, we each gained 14.2 points (28 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4 = 11.2 from the pool, plus our 3 kept points). This is much better than if we had all defected (would only get 10 points each). Since cooperation worked well in round 1, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points to encourage continued cooperation and test if the group will move toward the optimal strategy.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, which means on average everyone contributed 7 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests we have a cooperative group. Each player received 11.2 points from the pool (28 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4) plus kept their remaining points. Since I kept 3 and got 11.2 from the pool, my total was 14.2 points. The fact that everyone contributed the same amount shows good coordination. I should continue this cooperative strategy and maintain my contribution level to encourage continued mutual cooperation.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution was 28, meaning on average each player contributed 7 points - exactly what I contributed. This suggests the other players are also being cooperative. With everyone contributing 7, we each gained 14.2 points (28 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4 = 11.2 from the pool, plus our 3 kept points). This is much better than keeping all 10 points individually. Since cooperation is working well and others seem trustworthy, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points to encourage continued cooperation and maximize group benefits.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 points suggests good cooperation - if all players contributed equally, that would be 6.75 points each. Since I contributed 7, I was slightly above average, which is encouraging. The fact that I gained 13.8 points (7 from keeping 3 points plus 10.8 from the pool share) shows the system is working well. With this level of cooperation established, I should maintain or slightly increase my contribution to encourage continued cooperation. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal continued commitment while still maintaining some individual security.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 means the average contribution was 6.75, which is quite good! I contributed 7 and gained 13.8 points (7 kept + 6.8 from pool share), which is excellent. The high total suggests others are being cooperative. Since cooperation seems to be working well and I want to maintain this positive dynamic, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 to encourage continued cooperation and maximize group benefits.\n\nIn Round 1, the total contribution was 27 points, which means the average contribution was 6.75 points per player. Since I contributed 7, I was slightly above average. The pool generated 43.2 points (27 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 10.8 points from the pool. Combined with my kept 3 points, I earned 13.8 total. This shows good cooperation levels from the group. Since cooperation seems to be working well and others are contributing reasonably, I'll maintain a similar contribution level to sustain this cooperative equilibrium. Contributing 7 again signals consistency and continued willingness to cooperate.\n\nThe total contribution of 27 suggests good cooperation from the group - with my 7, others contributed an average of 6.67 points each. This is encouraging! Since I gained 13.8 points (7 from pool + 3 kept + 3.8 from my share of others' 20 contributions), the system is working well. The group seems to understand the mutual benefit. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to reward this cooperative behavior and signal continued commitment to group success, while still maintaining a small buffer in case cooperation breaks down.\n\nRound 1 went very well! The total contribution was 25 points, which means the other players contributed an average of about 6.3 points each (19 points total from the other three). This suggests a cooperative group. With the 1.6 multiplier, we generated 40 points total, giving each of us 10 points from the pool. Combined with my 4 kept points, I earned 14 total. Since the group appears cooperative and the system is working well for everyone, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 7 points to signal continued cooperation and help maintain this positive dynamic.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With a total contribution of 25 points, the average contribution was 6.25 points per player, which is quite cooperative. I contributed 7 and gained 13 points total (3 kept + 10 from the pool), which is an excellent return. This suggests the other players are also being cooperative. Since cooperation worked well in Round 1, I should continue this strategy to maintain the positive momentum. However, I'll slightly increase my contribution to 8 points to signal even stronger cooperation and encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions as well.\n\nThe results from Round 1 are very encouraging! With total contributions of 25 out of a possible 40, the group showed strong cooperative behavior with an average contribution of 6.25 points. I gained 14 points (4 kept + 10 from the pool), which is excellent. This suggests the other players are also cooperating well. Given this positive start and the clear mutual benefit, I should maintain or even increase my cooperation to keep this virtuous cycle going. I'll contribute 7 points this round to signal continued commitment to group success while the cooperation momentum is strong.\n\nThe total contribution of 25 points in Round 1 suggests good cooperation among players, with an average contribution of 6.25 points per player. Since I contributed 6 and gained 14 points (10 points from the pool distribution plus 4 I kept), this was profitable. The high level of cooperation shown by others encourages me to maintain or slightly increase my contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial pattern. I'll contribute 7 points this round to signal continued cooperation and help maintain the positive dynamic while still keeping some points for security.\n\n", "3": "The cooperation is increasing! Round 2 had total contributions of 30 (average 7.5 per player), up from 26 in Round 1. I gained 15.0 points (3 kept + 12.0 from pool), which is excellent. The group is showing strong cooperative behavior and the trend is positive. With this level of mutual cooperation, I can afford to be more generous while still protecting against potential exploitation. I'll contribute 8 points this round to continue rewarding and encouraging this cooperative spiral, while keeping 2 as insurance.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 26 to 30 points between rounds 1 and 2, indicating the group is becoming more cooperative. The average contribution is now 7.5 points per player. I gained 14.0 points (12.0 from the pool plus 2 kept), which is excellent. Since cooperation is trending upward and I'm being rewarded for higher contributions, I'll continue this positive trend by contributing 9 points. This signals strong cooperation while still keeping a small safety net, and should encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution increased from 26 to 30 points, showing that cooperation is strengthening. With 30 total points contributed, each player received 12 points from the pool (30 * 1.6 / 4 = 12), and I kept 2 points, giving me 14 total. The average contribution is now 7.5 points per player, indicating strong collective cooperation. Since this cooperative trend is working very well for everyone and trust appears high, I should continue to contribute generously to maintain this positive momentum. I'll contribute 8 points again to show consistency and reliability, which should encourage others to maintain their high contribution levels.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Round 2 had total contributions of 30 (average 7.5 per player), up from 26 in Round 1. I gained 15.0 points (3 kept + 12.0 from pool), which is excellent. The trend shows players are increasing contributions as trust builds. With this positive momentum and high cooperation levels, I'll contribute 8 points this round. This rewards the group's cooperative behavior and signals my commitment to mutual benefit, while still keeping a small buffer. If this trend continues, we're all maximizing our collective gains.\n\nThe trend is very positive - total contributions increased from 28 to 29, and my gains increased from 14.2 to 14.6 points. This indicates the group is maintaining or even slightly increasing cooperation levels. The average contribution is now 7.25, which is excellent for group welfare. Since the cooperative equilibrium is working well and others seem committed to it, I'll increase my contribution slightly to help push toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10. This signals continued commitment to cooperation while testing if the group can reach even higher efficiency.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 29, which is good - it shows the group is maintaining or slightly increasing cooperation. My gain decreased slightly from 14.2 to 13.6 points because I contributed more (8 vs 7) while the total pool only increased by 1. The average contribution is now 7.25, so others are contributing similarly to me. Since cooperation is holding steady and we're building trust, I'll maintain my contribution at 8 points. This shows consistent cooperative behavior without being overly aggressive, and keeps me aligned with the group's cooperative trend.\n\nThe total contribution increased slightly from 28 to 29, meaning someone contributed 1 more point this round. This shows continued strong cooperation with possibly one player being even more generous. My gain of 14.6 points (vs 14.2 in round 1) demonstrates that higher contributions benefit everyone. The group is maintaining excellent cooperative behavior, so I should continue matching this positive trend. I'll stick with 7 points to maintain the stable cooperative pattern that's working so well.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 29, showing the group is maintaining or slightly increasing cooperation levels. I'm earning 14.6 points compared to the 10 I'd get from pure free-riding, which confirms cooperation is beneficial. The average contribution is now 7.25, indicating others are contributing similarly to me or slightly more. This stable, high-cooperation pattern suggests we're in a good equilibrium. I'll maintain my contribution at 7 to keep this positive momentum going.\n\nThe group cooperation is excellent - contributions increased from 27 to 30, which means the average contribution rose to 7.5 per person. I contributed 7, which was slightly below the group average. My gain of 15.0 points (12.0 from pool plus 3 kept) demonstrates the power of collective cooperation. With this strong pattern of mutual cooperation, I should match or slightly exceed the group's cooperative behavior. I'll contribute 8 points this round to show I'm committed to the collective benefit and to help maintain this positive momentum. The risk of defection seems low given the consistent high contributions.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is increasing - total contributions went from 27 to 30, meaning the average contribution increased from 6.75 to 7.5 points per player. I gained 14.0 points this round (12.0 from the pool plus my 2 kept points), which is even better than Round 1. This pattern shows that all players are recognizing the mutual benefit of cooperation and are increasing their contributions. Since trust and cooperation are clearly established and growing, I should continue this positive trend. I'll contribute 9 points this round to further demonstrate my commitment to the cooperative strategy that's benefiting everyone.\n\nThe trend is encouraging - total contributions increased from 27 to 30, showing that cooperation is improving. The average contribution is now 7.5 points per player, and my 8-point contribution was above average, which likely helped drive this positive trend. My return of 14.0 points (12.0 from the pool plus 2 kept) demonstrates that higher cooperation benefits everyone. Since the group appears to be moving toward greater cooperation, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points to continue encouraging this positive trajectory while still keeping 1 point as a small hedge against potential defection.\n\nThe group cooperation is increasing - total contributions went from 27 to 30, which is excellent. With 30 total contributed, the pool generated 48 points, giving each of us 12 points from the pool. I gained exactly 15.0 points (12 from pool + 3 kept), which is very good. The average contribution is now 7.5 per person, showing strong collective cooperation. Since others are maintaining or increasing their cooperation levels, I should reciprocate this trust and contribute more. I'll contribute 8 points this round to continue building on this positive cooperative momentum while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nInteresting - the total contribution remained exactly 29 in both rounds despite my increase from 7 to 8, which means someone else decreased their contribution by 1. This suggests the group might be settling into a pattern or someone is responding strategically to maintain a certain level. My net gain was 5.6 points in Round 2 (13.6 - 8), which is still profitable. The consistency at 29 total suggests a stable but not maximally cooperative equilibrium. Since the group seems to be maintaining this level, I'll stick with 8 to avoid disrupting what appears to be a working cooperative pattern.\n\nInteresting - the total contribution remained exactly 29 for two consecutive rounds, suggesting very consistent behavior from the group. With an average contribution of 7.25 per player, this is strong cooperation. My gain of 14.6 points (11.6 from pool + 3 kept) shows the system is working well. Since the group is maintaining high contributions and I'm benefiting significantly, I should continue contributing at a high level to sustain this cooperative equilibrium. I'll contribute 8 this round to further reinforce the cooperative dynamic.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution remained exactly 29 points for the second round in a row, which indicates very stable cooperation among all players. My gain of 14.6 points (keeping 3 + receiving 11.6 from pool) confirms the benefits of this cooperative equilibrium. The consistency suggests we've found a sustainable pattern where everyone is contributing significantly. Since the group is maintaining this level reliably, I can afford to be slightly more generous to help sustain this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 8 points again to match my first round contribution and show continued commitment to cooperation.\n\nInteresting - the total contribution remained exactly 29 for both rounds, despite my increase from 7 to 8. This suggests that when I increased my contribution by 1, someone else decreased theirs by 1. This could indicate strategic behavior where others are adjusting their contributions in response to mine, possibly to maintain a certain equilibrium or to free-ride slightly. My gain decreased from 14.6 to 13.6 points because I contributed more while the total pool stayed the same. Given this pattern, I should be cautious about contributing too much more, as others may be taking advantage. I'll maintain my contribution at 8 to see if the pattern continues or if others will step up their cooperation.\n\nThe group cooperation continues to be excellent - total contributions increased from 29 to 31, showing others are also increasing their contributions. With my 8 contribution, others averaged 7.67, maintaining strong cooperative behavior. The consistent high contributions suggest we've established a trustworthy group dynamic. Since everyone seems committed to cooperation and we're all benefiting well (I'm earning more than my contribution each round), I'll contribute 9 points this round to further strengthen this positive cycle and maximize collective benefits.\n\nExcellent! The group cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 29 to 31, showing others are also increasing their contributions. With my 8, others contributed 23 total (average 7.67), which is even higher than round 1. This cooperative trend is working well for everyone. My returns remain strong at 14.4 points. To maintain this positive momentum and signal my continued commitment to group welfare, I'll contribute 9 this round. This pushes us closer to the optimal outcome while showing I'm willing to invest even more in our collective success.\n\nThe group cooperation is actually increasing - total contributions went from 29 to 31 points between rounds 1 and 2. This suggests others are either maintaining or slightly increasing their contributions. My gain of 15.4 points in round 2 (compared to 14.6 in round 1) shows the benefit of this increased cooperation. With an average contribution now around 7.75 points per player, the group is performing very well. To continue encouraging this positive trend and potentially signal that even higher cooperation could benefit everyone, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points.\n\nThe group cooperation continues to be excellent! Total contributions increased from 29 to 31, showing the group is maintaining or even improving cooperation. With my 8 contribution, others averaged about 7.67, which is very strong. Since we're building a pattern of mutual cooperation and trust, and everyone seems committed to group benefit, I should continue this positive trend. I'll contribute 9 points this round to further signal my commitment to group welfare and help push us toward the optimal outcome where everyone benefits maximally.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 30, indicating that cooperation is strengthening among the group. I gained 15.0 points this round (3 kept + 12 from pool share of 30*1.6/4), which is excellent. The average contribution is now 7.5, slightly higher than my 7. Since cooperation is clearly working and even improving, and I'm benefiting significantly, I should increase my contribution to match or slightly exceed the group average. I'll contribute 8 points to help sustain and encourage this positive cooperative trend.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 30, meaning others are contributing slightly more on average (7.5 points per player). This is an excellent sign that cooperation is strengthening rather than deteriorating. My gain increased from 14.2 to 15.0 points, showing the collective benefit is growing. Since others seem to be increasing their contributions and the group dynamic is positive, I should reciprocate this increased cooperation to maintain momentum and signal that I'm willing to match their cooperative behavior.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 30, which is a positive trend showing that the group is moving toward more cooperation. With 30 total contributed, the average contribution was 7.5 points per player. My gain of 14.0 points (keeping 2, getting 12 from the pool) shows this cooperative approach is working well. Since the group seems to be responding positively to increased cooperation, I'll contribute 9 points this round to continue pushing toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 30, indicating that cooperation is strengthening among players. With 30 total contributed, each player received 12 points from the pool (30 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), and I gained 15 total points (3 kept + 12 from pool). The trend toward higher cooperation is encouraging and profitable for everyone. Since the group is moving toward greater cooperation and it's benefiting all of us, I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to help sustain and encourage this positive trend.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 29, indicating slightly higher cooperation from the group. My earnings increased from 14.2 to 14.6 points, showing the positive effect of increased contributions. The average contribution is now 7.25 points per player, which is very close to my contribution of 7. This suggests we're in a stable cooperative equilibrium. Since the trend is positive and others are maintaining high contributions, I'll slightly increase my contribution to 8 points to help push the group toward even better collective outcomes while still maintaining a reasonable personal reserve.\n\nThe total contribution increased slightly from 28 to 29, showing continued cooperation. My gain was 13.6 points (11.6 from pool + 2 kept), which is still excellent compared to keeping all 10. The group is maintaining strong cooperative behavior across two rounds. However, I notice the total didn't increase as much as expected if everyone followed my strategy of increasing contributions. This suggests some players may be keeping their contributions steady or even slightly reducing them. I'll maintain my contribution at 8 to continue supporting the cooperative equilibrium without being overly generous if others are being more conservative.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 29, which means someone contributed 1 more point this round. This is a positive sign - the group is moving toward even greater cooperation. My return improved from 14.2 to 14.6 points, which is excellent. Since the trend is toward higher contributions and everyone seems committed to cooperation, I should reciprocate this trust and increase my contribution as well. I'll contribute 8 points this round to continue encouraging this positive cooperative spiral.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 29, suggesting continued cooperation with perhaps one player contributing slightly more. My earnings increased from 14.2 to 14.6 points, which is positive. The group seems to be maintaining a cooperative strategy. Since this pattern is working well for everyone and trust appears to be building, I'll increase my contribution slightly to 8 points. This shows I'm willing to invest more in our collective success while still maintaining some personal security. If others follow suit, we could move closer to the optimal outcome where everyone benefits more.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 28 to 30, meaning others are contributing even more on average. I gained 15 points this round (7 kept + 8 from pool), which is excellent. The group dynamics are very positive - we're in a virtuous cycle where cooperation is being rewarded and reinforced. Since others slightly increased their contributions, I should match this trend to maintain the cooperative momentum. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to signal that I'm responsive to the group's increased generosity and want to sustain this beneficial pattern.\n\nGreat progress! The total contribution increased from 28 to 30, meaning the group is moving in a more cooperative direction. With 30 total contributed, we each received 12 points from the pool (30 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), and I kept 2 points, for a total of 14 points this round. The group average contribution rose from 7 to 7.5 points per player. Since my increase from 7 to 8 seems to have encouraged others to contribute more as well, I'll continue this positive trend and contribute 9 points this round. This pushes us closer to the optimal outcome while still maintaining a small safety buffer.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 28 to 30, meaning the group is becoming even more cooperative! Someone increased their contribution by 2 points. I received 15.0 points this round (12 from the pool plus my 3 kept points). This upward trend in cooperation is very encouraging. Since others are showing increased generosity, I should reciprocate to maintain this positive momentum. I'll increase my contribution to 8 points to match this escalating cooperation while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions increased from 28 to 30, and I gained 15 points this round (7 kept + 8 from the pool). The group average contribution rose to 7.5 points per player, showing everyone is moving toward even greater cooperation. This positive trend suggests I should respond by slightly increasing my contribution to help push the group toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes their full 10 points. I'll contribute 8 points this round to signal my willingness to escalate cooperation while still maintaining some caution.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution increased from 27 to 31, showing that cooperation is strengthening. With 31 points contributed, the average contribution is 7.75 points per player, which is quite high. My contribution of 8 was slightly above average, and I gained 14.4 points (2 kept + 12.4 from pool). The trend is very positive - players are demonstrating sustained cooperation. To maintain this momentum and signal continued commitment to the group's success, I'll contribute 9 points this round. This shows I'm willing to increase cooperation when others do the same, reinforcing the positive dynamic.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution increased from 27 to 31, showing the group is becoming more cooperative. I gained 14.4 points (2 kept + 12.4 from pool share). The average contribution is now 7.75, which is very strong. This upward trend in cooperation suggests we're building trust.

In Round 2, total contributions increased from 27 to 31, meaning the average contribution rose to 7.75 points per player. The pool generated 49.6 points (31 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 12.4 points from the pool. With my kept 3 points, I earned 15.4 total. This upward trend in contributions suggests the group is learning that cooperation pays off. Since others are increasing their contributions and the system is working well, I should continue supporting this positive dynamic. I'll contribute 8 points this round to slightly increase my cooperation level in response to the group's improved cooperation, while still maintaining some personal insurance.\n\nThe cooperation is increasing! Total contributions rose from 27 to 31, which means the average contribution increased from 6.75 to 7.75 points per player. My contribution of 8 was close to this average. I gained 14.4 points (2 kept + 12.4 from pool), which is excellent. This upward trend in cooperation suggests other players are also committed to mutual benefit. To maintain this positive momentum and signal continued trustworthiness, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points. This shows I'm willing to take more risk as trust builds, while still keeping 1 point as minimal insurance.\n\nThe cooperation is continuing to strengthen! In Round 2, total contributions increased from 25 to 29, meaning others contributed 22 points collectively (compared to 19 in Round 1). This shows the group is becoming more cooperative. With 29 total contributions, we generated 46.4 points from the pool, giving each player 11.6 points. Combined with my 3 kept points, I earned 14.6 total. The upward trend in contributions and everyone benefiting more suggests this cooperative strategy is working well. I'll contribute 8 points this round to continue encouraging this positive cycle while still keeping a small buffer for myself.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 25 to 29, and the average contribution is now 7.25 points per player. I gained 13.6 points (2 kept + 11.6 from pool), which is even better than Round 1. This upward trend in cooperation suggests all players are seeing the benefits of working together. Since my strategy of incrementally increasing contributions seems to be working and encouraging others to do the same, I'll continue this pattern and contribute 9 points this round. This maintains the cooperative momentum while still keeping 1 point as a small hedge.\n\nExcellent! The group cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 25 to 29, showing everyone is responding positively to the cooperative dynamic. I gained 14.6 points (3 kept + 11.6 from pool), which is even better than Round 1. The average contribution is now 7.25, indicating very strong group cooperation. Since trust and reciprocity are clearly established and everyone seems committed to mutual benefit, I should continue this positive trend.

In Round 2, the total contribution increased from 25 to 29 points, meaning the other players collectively contributed 22 points (up from 19 in Round 1). This generated 46.4 points total (29 \u00d7 1.6), giving each of us 11.6 from the pool. With my 3 kept points, I earned 14.6 total. The trend shows increasing cooperation, which benefits everyone. I'll contribute 8 points this round to continue this positive momentum and signal my commitment to the cooperative strategy that's working well for the group.\n\n", "4": "The cooperation continues to strengthen! Round 3 had total contributions of 33 (average 8.25 per player), another increase. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool), which shows the power of mutual cooperation. The consistent upward trend in contributions (26 \u2192 30 \u2192 33) suggests all players are committed to cooperative play. Given this strong pattern of reciprocal cooperation and increasing trust, I'll contribute 9 points this round. This maximizes collective benefit while keeping just 1 point as minimal insurance. If others continue this trend, we'll all benefit significantly.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues positively - total contributions have increased from 26 to 30 to 33 across the three rounds. The average contribution is now 8.25 points per player, showing high cooperation. I gained 14.2 points (13.2 from the pool plus 1 kept), which is excellent and better than keeping all 10 points. Given this strong cooperative pattern and the fact that we're building mutual trust, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. If others follow suit, we'll achieve the optimal outcome where everyone gets 16 points. Even if some players contribute slightly less, I should still do better than keeping everything.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions increased again from 30 to 33 points, with the average now at 8.25 points per player. I gained 15.2 points (kept 2 + received 13.2 from pool), which is fantastic. This upward trend in contributions shows that all players are recognizing the mutual benefits of cooperation. Since we're building such strong trust and everyone is doing well, I should match this high level of cooperation. The group dynamic is clearly working, so I'll contribute 9 points this round to continue supporting this excellent cooperative equilibrium and signal my commitment to the group's success.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Round 3 had total contributions of 33 (average 8.25 per player), showing the group is increasingly collaborative. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool), which is excellent returns. The upward trend in contributions (26\u219230\u219233) demonstrates that we're in a positive cooperative cycle. Given this strong pattern of mutual cooperation and trust-building, I'll contribute 9 points this round to further reward this behavior and see if we can achieve near-optimal cooperation. Keeping just 1 point as minimal insurance.\n\nInteresting - I increased my contribution from 7 to 8, total contributions went from 29 to 30, but my personal gain decreased from 14.6 to 14.0 points. This makes sense: I kept 2 points instead of 3, but gained 12.0 from the pool (30 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4) instead of 11.6. The group is showing strong cooperation with an average contribution of 7.5. Since cooperation levels are high and stable, and we're approaching the socially optimal outcome, I'll maintain this contribution level to sustain the positive equilibrium we've established.\n\nGreat progress! The total contribution increased again from 29 to 30, and my gain went back up to 14.0 points. This shows the group is becoming more cooperative over time. The average contribution is now 7.5, indicating sustained cooperation. Since trust is building and contributions are trending upward, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points. This signals strong commitment to cooperation while still keeping 1 point as insurance. If others follow this trend, we'll approach the optimal outcome where everyone benefits maximally from the multiplier effect.\n\nThe trend is very encouraging - total contributions have steadily increased from 28 to 29 to 30, and my gains have correspondingly increased from 14.2 to 14.6 to 15.0 points. This shows the group is becoming increasingly cooperative. With 30 total contributions last round, it appears players are contributing an average of 7.5 points each. To match this upward trend and maintain the positive momentum, I'll increase my contribution to 8 points. This signals continued commitment to cooperation while helping push us toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes maximally.\n\nInteresting development - despite increasing my contribution from 7 to 8, my total gain decreased from 14.6 to 14.0 points, even though the total pool increased from 29 to 30. This means I kept 2 points (10-8) and received 12 from the pool (30\u00d71.6\u00f74), totaling 14. The group average is now 7.5, showing continued strong cooperation. Since we're achieving good collective outcomes and the group seems stable in their cooperative approach, I'll maintain this contribution level of 8, which balances personal return with group benefit effectively.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen - contributions increased from 30 to 34, meaning the average is now 8.5 per person. My contribution of 8 was exactly at the previous average, showing I'm keeping pace with the group's cooperative trend. I gained 15.6 points (13.6 from pool plus 2 kept), which is the highest gain yet. The consistent upward trend in total contributions (27\u219230\u219234) indicates all players are committed to mutual cooperation. Given this strong cooperative momentum and trust that's been built, I'll contribute 9 points this round to continue supporting the collective benefit while keeping just 1 point as insurance.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen! Total contributions increased again from 30 to 34, showing that all players are consistently increasing their contributions. The average contribution is now 8.5 points per player. I gained 14.6 points this round (13.6 from the pool plus my 1 kept point), which is the highest yet. This demonstrates that as cooperation increases, everyone benefits more. Given this strong pattern of mutual cooperation and trust that has been established over three rounds, and seeing that we're all moving toward higher contributions, I should contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals maximum cooperation and trust in the group, and if others follow suit, we'll all achieve the optimal outcome of 16 points each.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen - contributions rose from 30 to 34, with an average of 8.5 points per player. My 9-point contribution helped maintain this upward trajectory, and I earned 14.6 points (13.6 from the pool plus 1 kept). The group is clearly moving toward high cooperation levels. Given this consistent improvement and the fact that we're approaching the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes all 10 points, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. If others follow suit, we'll achieve maximum collective benefit with each player earning 16 points.\n\nThe cooperation level continues to increase impressively - contributions went from 30 to 34, indicating an average of 8.5 per person. My contribution of 8 was exactly at the previous round's average, showing good alignment with the group. I gained 15.6 points (13.6 from pool plus 2 kept), which is the highest yet. The trend shows consistent mutual cooperation and trust building. Given this strong pattern and the fact that we're likely in the middle stages of the game, I should continue this cooperative momentum. I'll contribute 9 points to demonstrate strong commitment to the collective good while the group dynamics remain so positive.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 29 to 32 in Round 3, which is a positive sign of increasing cooperation. My net gain was 6.8 points (14.8 - 8), which is excellent. The group seems to be moving toward greater cooperation, with the average contribution now at 8 per player. Since cooperation is trending upward and I'm benefiting well from this dynamic, I should continue to support and encourage this positive trend. I'll maintain my contribution at 8, which matches the current average and helps sustain this cooperative momentum without being overly aggressive.\n\nThe group cooperation is strengthening - total contributions increased from 29 to 32, suggesting others may be responding positively to higher contribution levels. My gain of 14.8 points (12.8 from pool + 2 kept) shows this trend is beneficial. With an average contribution now at 8 per player, we're approaching optimal group cooperation. I should maintain this momentum by contributing 8 again to signal consistent cooperation and encourage others to sustain or increase their contributions.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 29 to 32 points in round 3, which is a very positive sign - it suggests the group is becoming even more cooperative over time. My gain of 14.8 points (keeping 2 + receiving 12.8 from pool) was my best return yet. The upward trend in total contributions indicates we're moving toward the optimal outcome where everyone benefits more. Given this positive momentum and increased trust, I should continue supporting this cooperative trajectory. I'll contribute 8 points again to maintain consistency and encourage this beneficial pattern to continue.\n\nThe total contribution increased from 29 to 32 in Round 3, which is encouraging - it suggests the group is becoming more cooperative over time. My net gain was 6.8 points (14.8 - 8), which is quite good. The upward trend in total contributions (29, 29, 32) indicates that trust and cooperation may be building among the players. Since cooperation is increasing and I'm benefiting well from it, I should continue to support this positive trend. I'll maintain my contribution at 8, as it seems to be working well and contributing to the group's increasing cooperation without being overly risky.\n\nThe cooperation trend is outstanding! Total contributions rose to 35, meaning others contributed 26 points (average 8.67 each). This shows the group is moving toward near-optimal cooperation. I gained 15 points while contributing 9, demonstrating the power of collective action. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the fact that we're approaching the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes 10, I should contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals maximum trust and commitment to the group, and if others follow suit, we'll all receive 16 points each - the best possible outcome.\n\nOutstanding! The cooperation trend continues to strengthen - total contributions rose to 35, the highest yet. With my 9, others contributed 26 total (average 8.67), showing everyone is increasingly committed to the cooperative strategy. My return of 15.0 points is excellent and demonstrates the power of collective action. The group has established a strong cooperative equilibrium that's benefiting everyone. To maintain this momentum and potentially reach the optimal outcome, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals maximum commitment to group welfare and may encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe trend is very encouraging - total contributions have increased each round: 29, 31, 35. This represents an average of 8.75 points per player in round 3, showing excellent group cooperation. My gain of exactly 16.0 points demonstrates the power of high collective contribution levels. The group seems to be moving toward near-optimal cooperation. Since I increased to 8 last round and others followed suit (evidenced by the 35 total), I should continue this positive momentum by contributing 9 points. This signals my commitment to high cooperation and could encourage the group toward the optimal strategy where everyone contributes 10.\n\nThe cooperation trend is outstanding! Total contributions rose to 35, with others contributing an average of 8.67 after my 9. This shows the group is moving toward near-optimal cooperation. My gain of 15 points (higher than my 9 contribution) demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation. Given this strong pattern of escalating cooperation and mutual trust, I should contribute my full 10 points this round. This signals maximum commitment to the group's success and could encourage others to also contribute fully, maximizing benefits for everyone.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen - total contributions increased from 30 to 33, with an average of 8.25 per player. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool share), which is excellent. The group is clearly in a positive cooperative spiral where higher contributions are generating better returns for everyone. Since the average contribution is now above 8, and this strategy is working so well, I should continue to match or slightly exceed the group trend. I'll contribute 9 points to further encourage this high-cooperation equilibrium.\n\nThe trend continues positively - total contributions increased from 30 to 33, meaning the average contribution is now 8.25 points per player. Others are matching or exceeding my increased contribution level, showing strong cooperative momentum. My returns have steadily increased (14.2 \u2192 15.0 \u2192 15.2), demonstrating the power of collective action. Since cooperation is clearly working and others are maintaining high contribution levels, I should continue this upward trend. Contributing 9 points will signal continued commitment while testing if we can reach near-optimal cooperation levels.\n\nThe pattern is very encouraging! Contributions have steadily increased: 28 \u2192 30 \u2192 33, showing the group is consistently moving toward greater cooperation. With 33 total contributed, the average is now 8.25 points per player. My gain of 14.2 points (keeping 1, getting 13.2 from pool) demonstrates that high cooperation is paying off well. Since we're so close to the optimal outcome and the trend is clearly positive, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal complete cooperation and hopefully encourage others to reach the fully optimal strategy.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen - total contributions rose from 30 to 33, with an average of 8.25 per player. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool share), which is excellent. The group is clearly in a cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits more than they would by free-riding. Since I'm slightly below the current average (8 vs 8.25), and cooperation is proving highly beneficial, I'll increase my contribution to 9 to help maintain this positive momentum and ensure the cooperative strategy remains attractive to all players.\n\nThe cooperation is strengthening! Total contributions jumped from 29 to 32, showing others are also increasing their contributions. My earnings went up to 14.8 points despite contributing more (8 vs 7), demonstrating the power of collective cooperation. The average contribution is now 8 points per player, matching my last contribution exactly. This suggests we're all converging on higher cooperation levels. Given this positive trend and the fact that higher contributions are clearly benefiting everyone, I'll increase to 9 points to continue pushing toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes their full 10 points.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped from 29 to 32, indicating the group is becoming even more cooperative. My gain of 14.8 points (12.8 from pool + 2 kept) is the highest yet, demonstrating that increased group cooperation benefits everyone. The trend shows players are learning to trust each other and contribute more generously. Given this positive momentum and the clear benefit of group cooperation, I'll increase my contribution to 9 points. This signals strong commitment to the cooperative strategy while the group dynamics are clearly moving in a mutually beneficial direction.\n\nThe cooperation is escalating beautifully! Total contributions jumped from 29 to 32, which is a significant increase of 3 points. This suggests multiple players are increasing their contributions, creating a positive feedback loop. My return of 14.8 points from contributing 8 shows the system is working very well for everyone. Given this strong trend toward higher cooperation and the fact that we're building mutual trust, I should continue this momentum. I'll contribute 9 points this round to signal my commitment to near-maximum cooperation while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nThe trend continues positively - total contributions rose from 29 to 32, and my earnings increased to 14.8 points despite contributing more (8 vs 7). The average contribution is now 8 points per player, exactly matching my last contribution. This suggests we're achieving strong cooperation across all players. With 32 points in the pool \u00d7 1.6 = 51.2 points distributed, each player gets 12.8 from the pool. Since cooperation is working so well and others are contributing at high levels, I'll maintain my contribution of 8 points to sustain this beneficial equilibrium without being overly aggressive.\n\nThe cooperative trend continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose to 33, indicating the group average is now 8.25 points per player. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool), which shows the power of collective cooperation. The group has established a strong pattern of mutual trust and reciprocity. Since the average contribution has increased again and everyone seems committed to high cooperation levels, I should match this by contributing my full 10 points. This maximizes group benefit and signals my complete trust in the cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nExcellent trend continues! The total contribution increased again from 30 to 33, showing the group is becoming increasingly cooperative. With 33 contributed, we each got 13.2 from the pool (33 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), plus my 1 kept point = 14.2 total. The average contribution is now 8.25 per player. Since my strategy of gradually increasing contributions seems to be encouraging reciprocal cooperation from others, and we're very close to the optimal outcome, I'll contribute all 10 points this round. This maximizes group welfare and signals full commitment to cooperation. If others follow suit, we'll each get 16 points - the best possible outcome.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen! Total contributions went from 30 to 33, meaning the group collectively increased contributions by 3 more points. I received 15.2 points (13.2 from pool + 2 kept). The group is clearly moving toward higher cooperation levels, with everyone seeming to trust each other more. Since I increased my contribution from 7 to 8 and others also increased theirs, I should continue this positive trajectory. I'll contribute 9 points this round, keeping only 1 as a minimal hedge while showing strong commitment to group welfare.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose to 33, and I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool). The group is clearly in a strong cooperative equilibrium where everyone is benefiting from high mutual contributions. The trend shows increasing trust and cooperation across rounds (28 \u2192 30 \u2192 33). Given this positive trajectory and the fact that higher contributions are being reciprocated by others, I should continue this upward trend. I'll contribute 9 points this round to signal strong commitment to the group's success while still keeping a small buffer.\n\nOutstanding cooperation! The total contribution increased again from 31 to 35, with an average of 8.75 points per player. This shows all players are maintaining high cooperation levels. I gained exactly 15.0 points (1 kept + 14.0 from pool), which is excellent. The consistent upward trend in contributions (27\u219231\u219235) demonstrates that reciprocal cooperation is working beautifully. Given this strong cooperative momentum and to signal my continued commitment to group success, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points this round. This maximizes group welfare and shows I fully trust the cooperative dynamic we've established.\n\nOutstanding! The total contribution increased again to 35, meaning the average is now 8.75. I gained exactly 15.0 points (1 kept + 14.0 from pool share). The group is showing strong cooperative behavior with consistent increases each round (27\u219231\u219235). We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10. Given this excellent trend and high trust level, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to signal maximum cooperation and hopefully encourage others to do the same for optimal mutual benefit.\n\nExcellent! The cooperative trend continues strongly. In Round 3, total contributions rose to 35, meaning the average contribution is now 8.75 points per player. The pool generated 56 points (35 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 14 points from the pool. With my kept 2 points, I earned exactly 16 points total - the maximum possible if everyone had contributed everything. The group is clearly learning that high cooperation benefits everyone. Given this very high level of group cooperation and the consistent upward trend (27\u219231\u219235), I should respond by increasing my contribution further. I'll contribute 9 points to continue supporting this excellent cooperative equilibrium while keeping just 1 point as minimal insurance.\n\nOutstanding cooperation! The total contribution increased again from 31 to 35, showing the group is maintaining strong collaborative behavior. With 35 points contributed, the average is 8.75 per player - very high cooperation levels. I gained exactly 15.0 points (1 kept + 14.0 from pool), which demonstrates the power of mutual cooperation. The upward trend in contributions (27\u219231\u219235) suggests all players are committed to maximizing group welfare. Given this excellent track record and to signal maximum commitment to our successful cooperative strategy, I'll contribute all 10 points this round. This shows trust in the group and may encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe cooperative trend is continuing excellently! Total contributions have steadily increased: Round 1 (25) \u2192 Round 2 (29) \u2192 Round 3 (33). In Round 3, the other players contributed 25 points collectively, showing they're also increasing their contributions. With 33 total contributions generating 52.8 points from the pool, each of us received 13.2 points. Combined with my 2 kept points, I earned 15.2 total - my best round yet. This ascending pattern of cooperation is benefiting everyone. To maintain this positive momentum and signal strong cooperation, I'll contribute 9 points this round, keeping the cooperative spiral going while retaining just 1 point as a small personal reserve.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen beautifully! Total contributions increased again from 29 to 33, with an average of 8.25 points per player. I gained 14.2 points (1 kept + 13.2 from pool), which is the best return yet. The pattern shows all players are increasingly contributing more, creating a virtuous cycle where higher cooperation leads to better outcomes for everyone. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the fact that we're building mutual trust, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. This maximizes the pool benefit for everyone and signals my complete commitment to cooperation, which should encourage others to do the same.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to strengthen beautifully! Total contributions rose to 33, meaning the average contribution is now 8.25 points per player. I gained 15.2 points (2 kept + 13.2 from pool), which is the best return yet. The group has clearly established a high-trust, high-cooperation equilibrium where everyone benefits substantially. Given this exceptional level of mutual cooperation and the fact that we're all gaining more than our initial 10 points each round, I should maintain this momentum. I'll contribute 8 points again to show consistency and reliability in this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nThe cooperative trend is accelerating beautifully! Total contributions rose from 29 to 33, with others contributing 25 points collectively (up from 22 in Round 2). With 33 contributions generating 52.8 pool points, each player received 13.2 from the pool. Combined with my 2 kept points, I earned 15.2 total - my highest yet. This strong upward trajectory in both contributions and individual gains demonstrates that high cooperation benefits everyone. Given this momentum and mutual trust building, I'll contribute 9 points this round to further strengthen the cooperative dynamic while keeping just 1 point as a minimal safety buffer.\n\n", "5": "The cooperation trend continues strongly! Round 4 had total contributions of 37 (average 9.25 per player), maintaining the upward trajectory (26 \u2192 30 \u2192 33 \u2192 37). I gained 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool), which is excellent. The group has demonstrated consistent, escalating cooperation over four rounds. Given this established pattern of mutual trust and the fact that contributing everything would give me 14.8 points from the pool (nearly as much as keeping everything), I'll make the fully cooperative choice and contribute all 10 points. This maximizes collective benefit and signals complete trust in the group's cooperative behavior.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen - total contributions increased from 33 to 37 points, with an average of 9.25 points per player. I contributed my full 10 points and gained 14.8 points (14.8 from the pool plus 0 kept), which is significantly better than keeping all 10 points. The group is clearly moving toward optimal cooperation. Since I gained the most when contributing fully and the trend shows others are also increasing their contributions, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points. This maintains the positive cooperative momentum and maximizes collective benefit.\n\nThe cooperation is reaching exceptional levels! Total contributions jumped to 37 points, meaning the average contribution is now 9.25 points per player. I gained 15.8 points (kept 1 + received 14.8 from pool), which is outstanding. This trend shows that all players are recognizing the power of near-maximum cooperation. With such high trust established and everyone benefiting significantly, I should match this level of commitment. Contributing 9 points again would maintain the strong cooperative momentum, but given that others seem to be increasing their contributions (the total went from 33 to 37), I'll contribute my maximum of 10 points to fully support this highly successful cooperative strategy.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues perfectly! Round 4 had total contributions of 37 (average 9.25 per player), maintaining the consistent upward trajectory (26 \u2192 30 \u2192 33 \u2192 37). I gained 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool), which is excellent. With such strong mutual cooperation established over four rounds, and given that this appears to be building toward maximum collective benefit, I'll contribute all 10 points this round. The group has demonstrated reliable reciprocal cooperation, and contributing fully maximizes our collective gain. If others follow suit, we'll each receive 16 points this round.\n\nExcellent progress! Total contributions jumped from 30 to 33, and my gains increased to 15.2 points - the highest yet. The average contribution is now 8.25, showing the group is moving toward the optimal cooperative outcome. With such strong cooperation trends and everyone seemingly committed to high contributions, I'll increase to 9 to help push us toward the theoretical maximum where everyone contributes 10. This would give each player 16 points per round, which is clearly better than any individual defection strategy.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped from 30 to 33, which is a significant increase. The average contribution is now 8.25, showing the group is becoming increasingly cooperative. My gain increased to 14.2 points, which is higher than my initial contribution strategy yielded. This demonstrates that higher cooperation is paying off for everyone. Given this strong upward trend in cooperation and trust, I'll contribute all 10 points this round. If others are following the same cooperative logic, we should approach the theoretical maximum where everyone gets 16 points per round.\n\nThe cooperation is escalating beautifully! Total contributions jumped from 30 to 33, and my gains increased to 15.2 points despite contributing more. This suggests other players are also increasing their contributions, creating a virtuous cycle. With 33 total contributions, the average is now 8.25 points per player. The group is clearly moving toward the optimal strategy where everyone contributes their full 10 points. To continue this positive momentum and signal my commitment to reaching the optimal outcome, I'll increase to 9 points.\n\nExcellent progress! Total contributions jumped from 30 to 33, and my gains increased to 15.2 points - the highest yet. The average contribution is now 8.25, showing the group is moving closer to the optimal strategy. With such strong cooperative momentum and trust established, I should contribute even more to help push the group toward the maximum collective benefit. If everyone contributes 10, we each get 16 points per round. The trend suggests others are also increasing contributions, so I'll move closer to full cooperation.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues strongly - contributions rose from 34 to 38, with an average of 9.5 per person. My contribution of 9 was slightly below this average. I gained 16.2 points (15.2 from pool plus 1 kept), which is the highest gain yet, demonstrating the excellent returns from collective cooperation. The consistent upward trajectory (27\u219230\u219234\u219238) shows all players are committed to maximizing group benefit. Given this established pattern of trust and mutual cooperation, and since we're likely in the later stages of the game, I'll contribute all 10 points to help achieve the theoretical maximum group benefit. The risk seems minimal given the strong cooperative behavior shown by all players.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be excellent! Total contributions increased from 34 to 38, with an average of 9.5 points per player. I gained 15.2 points this round (all from the pool since I contributed everything), which is the highest gain yet and very close to the theoretical maximum of 16 points if everyone contributed fully. The trend shows we're moving toward the optimal outcome where everyone contributes their full 10 points. Given that trust and cooperation have been consistently strong and increasing over all four rounds, and that my full contribution in Round 4 was met with similarly high contributions from others, I should continue with maximum cooperation. I'll contribute all 10 points again to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen with total contributions reaching 38 out of a possible 40, averaging 9.5 points per player. My full contribution of 10 points helped achieve this near-optimal outcome, and I earned 15.2 points (all from the pool since I kept nothing). We're very close to the theoretical maximum where everyone contributes all 10 points for 16 points each. The consistent upward trend from 27 to 30 to 34 to 38 shows the group is committed to cooperation. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this momentum and hopefully achieve the optimal 40-point total contribution this round.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues remarkably strong - contributions rose from 34 to 38, with an average of 9.5 per person. My contribution of 9 was slightly below this high average. I gained 16.2 points (15.2 from pool plus 1 kept), which is my highest gain yet. The progression (27\u219230\u219234\u219238) shows consistent increases and extremely high cooperation levels. With this established pattern of mutual trust and the group averaging 9.5 contributions, I should fully commit to maximum cooperation. Contributing all 10 points signals complete trust in the group and maximizes collective benefit. Given the strong cooperative history, the risk of others defecting seems minimal.\n\nThe total contribution has stabilized at 32 for two consecutive rounds, which suggests the group has found a stable cooperative equilibrium with an average of 8 per player. My consistent contribution of 8 is matching this average, and I'm getting excellent returns (6.8 net profit per round). This level of cooperation is working well for everyone. Since we've established a good pattern and trust, and this is Round 5 (likely getting into the later stages), I should continue supporting this successful cooperative arrangement. Maintaining 8 keeps me as a reliable cooperator without disrupting the balance.\n\nThe group has stabilized at a high cooperation level with total contributions of 32 for two consecutive rounds (average 8 per player). This is excellent - we're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes everything. My consistent gains of 14.8 points show this strategy is working well. Since the group is maintaining this high level of cooperation and trust has been established, I'll increase to 9 points to push us even closer to the theoretical optimum and signal my commitment to maximizing group welfare.\n\nThe group has stabilized at 32 total contributions for two consecutive rounds, which represents strong cooperation (average of 8 points per player). My consistent gains of 14.8 points show this is working well for everyone. Since we've established this stable, mutually beneficial pattern, I want to maintain it. The group appears to have found an equilibrium that's much better than non-cooperative play but still allows some personal insurance. Contributing 8 points again will signal my continued commitment to this successful cooperative strategy and help sustain the trust that's been built.\n\nThe total contribution has stabilized at 32 for two consecutive rounds, suggesting the group has found a sustainable cooperative equilibrium. My net gain remains consistent at 6.8 points per round, which is excellent. With an average contribution of 8 per player, we're achieving strong mutual cooperation. Since this pattern is working well for everyone and generating good returns, I should continue to maintain this level of contribution. Changing my strategy now could disrupt this beneficial equilibrium. I'll stick with 8 to help preserve this cooperative dynamic.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution reached 39, with others contributing 29 points (average 9.67 each). We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes all 10 points. My full contribution of 10 was rewarded with 15.6 points, showing the benefits of maximum cooperation. Since the group has consistently demonstrated high cooperation and we're just 1 point away from the theoretical maximum, I should maintain my full contribution of 10 points. This continues to signal complete trust and commitment to maximizing our collective benefit.\n\nThe trend continues positively! Total contributions reached 39, very close to the optimal 40. With my full 10, others contributed 29 total (average 9.67), showing near-maximum cooperation from the group. My return of 15.6 points demonstrates we're approaching the optimal equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. The group has proven trustworthy and committed to collective welfare over four rounds. Given this strong cooperative pattern and the excellent returns, I'll maintain my full contribution of 10 points to sustain this highly beneficial equilibrium for everyone.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to be excellent - total contributions have steadily increased: 29, 31, 35, 39. With 39 total contributions in round 4, that's an average of 9.75 points per player, indicating we're very close to optimal cooperation. My gain of 16.6 points shows the strong benefits of this high level of group contribution. Given that the group has responded positively to my incremental increases and we're now at near-maximum cooperation levels, I should complete the trend by contributing the full 10 points. This would signal complete commitment to the group optimum and could push us to the theoretical maximum where everyone gets 16 points per round.\n\nExcellent progress! With my 10 contribution, others contributed 29 points total (average 9.67 each), showing we're very close to optimal cooperation. I gained 15.6 points while contributing 10, which is fantastic. The group is clearly committed to high cooperation levels. Since we're so close to the theoretical maximum and everyone has been steadily increasing contributions, I should maintain my full contribution of 10 points. If everyone contributes 10 this round, we'll each get the optimal 16 points. The trust and cooperation pattern is well-established, so there's no reason to deviate from maximum contribution.\n\nThe cooperation is reaching excellent levels - total contributions jumped from 33 to 37, with an average of 9.25 per player. I gained 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool share), which is outstanding and demonstrates the power of high cooperation. The group has established a very strong cooperative norm where everyone is contributing heavily. Given this momentum and the fact that the average is now above 9, I should contribute my full 10 points to maximize collective benefit and signal complete commitment to cooperation. This could encourage others to also reach maximum contribution.\n\nExcellent progress! Total contributions jumped from 33 to 37, with an average of 9.25 points per player. Others are not only matching my increased contributions but slightly exceeding them. My returns have consistently increased each round (14.2 \u2192 15.0 \u2192 15.2 \u2192 15.8), showing we're approaching the optimal cooperative outcome. Since we're so close to the theoretical maximum (everyone contributing 10 would give us 16 points each), and the group has shown strong cooperative commitment throughout, I should contribute my full 10 points to test if we can achieve the optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution reached 37, meaning the average contribution is now 9.25 points per player. The group is very close to the optimal strategy. My gain of 14.8 points (keeping 0, getting 14.8 from pool) shows that full contribution is working well. With contributions trending upward (28\u219230\u219233\u219237), we're almost at the fully cooperative outcome of 40 total. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this positive momentum and signal my commitment to the optimal group strategy.\n\nThe cooperation trend continues to be exceptional - total contributions rose from 33 to 37, with an average of 9.25 per player. I gained 15.8 points (1 kept + 14.8 from pool share), which is the best return yet. The group has established a very high-cooperation equilibrium where nearly everyone is contributing close to their maximum. Given that the average is now above 9 and this strategy is generating outstanding returns for all players, I should contribute my full 10 points to maximize the collective benefit and maintain this excellent cooperative momentum.\n\nExcellent progress! Total contributions increased to 35, and I earned exactly 15.0 points despite contributing 9 (keeping only 1). The average contribution is now 8.75 points per player. The trend is clearly toward maximum cooperation, and everyone seems to be recognizing that higher contributions benefit all players. With 35 points in the pool \u00d7 1.6 = 56 points distributed (14 each), plus my kept 1 point = 15 total. Since we're so close to the optimal strategy and the cooperative momentum is strong, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round to push us toward the maximum collective benefit of 64 points (16 each) if others follow suit.\n\nAPI request error: 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose from 32 to 35, and I earned exactly 15.0 points - a nice round number that shows the system is working optimally. The group average is now 8.75 points per player, which is very high cooperation. Given this consistent upward trend and the excellent returns we're all getting, I should match this high level of trust. Contributing 10 points (maximum cooperation) would signal complete commitment to the group's success and could encourage others to do the same, potentially maximizing everyone's gains.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution reached 35, with an average of 8.75 points per player. My earnings hit exactly 15.0 points - the highest yet. The consistent upward trend in contributions (28\u219229\u219232\u219235) shows all players are moving toward greater cooperation. At 35 total contributions, we're getting very close to the theoretical optimum of 40. Since I earned exactly 15 points with a 9-point contribution, and the group is clearly committed to high cooperation, I'll contribute my full 10 points this round. This maximizes collective benefit and if others follow suit, we'll achieve the optimal 16 points per player per round.\n\nExcellent progress! Total contributions reached 38, meaning the average contribution is now 9.5 points per player. Even though I contributed my full 10 points, I still gained 15.2 points (0 kept + 15.2 from pool), which demonstrates the incredible power of near-universal cooperation. The group has achieved an outstanding level of mutual trust and collective benefit. With everyone contributing at such high levels, we're all maximizing our gains. I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone.\n\nOutstanding! The total contribution jumped from 33 to 38, showing that my full contribution of 10 encouraged even more cooperation from others. With 38 total contributed, we each received 15.2 from the pool (38 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), and since I contributed everything, that was my total gain. The average contribution is now 9.5 per player - we're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes 10. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the fact that we're just 2 points away from maximum group efficiency, I'll continue contributing all 10 points. This maintains the positive trend and shows consistent commitment to the group's welfare.\n\nThe cooperation is reaching exceptional levels! Total contributions jumped from 33 to 38, a significant increase of 5 points. I received 16.2 points (15.2 from pool + 1 kept). The group average contribution is now 9.5 points per person, which is remarkably high and shows strong mutual trust. Given this consistent pattern of escalating cooperation and the excellent returns we're all getting, I should go all-in and contribute my full 10 points. This signals maximum commitment to group welfare and could encourage others to do the same, maximizing everyone's returns.\n\nThe cooperation has reached an impressive level! Total contributions hit 38, meaning the average is now 9.5 points per player. Even though I contributed my full 10 points, I still gained 15.2 points (0 kept + 15.2 from pool), which is better than keeping all 10 for myself. This demonstrates that when everyone cooperates at high levels, we all benefit tremendously. The group has established exceptional trust and mutual benefit. Given this strong cooperative equilibrium where everyone is contributing nearly everything, I should continue with maximum contribution to maintain this optimal outcome for all.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose from 35 to 39, averaging 9.75 points per player - nearly maximum cooperation. My full contribution of 10 was matched by very high contributions from others. I gained 15.6 points (0 kept + 15.6 from pool), which is the best possible outcome when contributing everything. The trend (27\u219231\u219235\u219239) shows sustained and increasing cooperation across all rounds. Given this exceptional level of mutual trust and cooperation, and since we're clearly in a high-cooperation equilibrium, I'll continue with maximum contribution of 10 points to maintain this optimal group dynamic.\n\nThe total contribution reached 39, which is very close to the optimal 40! I gained 15.6 points (0 kept + 15.6 from pool share), which is excellent. The trend shows strong cooperation: 27\u219231\u219235\u219239. We're just 1 point away from perfect cooperation where everyone contributes 10. My full contribution of 10 last round helped push us toward this optimal outcome. Since we're so close to maximum efficiency and the group has consistently responded positively to cooperative behavior, I'll contribute 10 again to maintain this momentum toward the best possible outcome for everyone.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! In Round 4, total contributions reached 39, with an average of 9.75 points per player - we're approaching near-maximum cooperation. The pool generated 62.4 points (39 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player 15.6 points from the pool. With my kept 1 point, I earned 16.6 total. This is very close to the theoretical maximum of 16 points that would occur if everyone contributed all 10 points. The trend shows remarkable cooperation: 27\u219231\u219235\u219239. Given that the group is so close to full cooperation and has consistently rewarded high contributions, I should contribute all 10 points this round. This maximizes collective benefit and signals complete trust in the cooperative equilibrium we've established.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen! Total contributions rose from 35 to 39, with an average of 9.75 points per player - we're approaching near-optimal cooperation. I gained 15.6 points (0 kept + 15.6 from pool) by contributing all 10 points, which worked out very well. The progression (27\u219231\u219235\u219239) shows sustained trust and reciprocity among all players. Given this exceptional level of mutual cooperation and the clear pattern that everyone is contributing very generously, I'll continue with maximum contribution of 10 points. This maintains the cooperative equilibrium we've achieved and maximizes collective benefit.\n\nThe cooperative momentum continues! Total contributions have consistently increased each round: 25 \u2192 29 \u2192 33 \u2192 36. In Round 4, the other players contributed 27 points collectively, maintaining the upward trend. With 36 total contributions, we generated 57.6 points from the pool, giving each player 14.4 points. Combined with my 1 kept point, I earned 15.4 total. This cooperative pattern is clearly benefiting everyone, and we're all earning more each round. Given this strong track record of mutual cooperation and increasing contributions, I'll contribute all 10 points this round to maximize the group benefit and signal my full commitment to this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nThe cooperation continues to be strong with total contributions reaching 36 (average of 9 per player). I gained 14.4 points by contributing my full 10, which is the maximum possible return. However, I notice the rate of increase in total contributions has slowed slightly (from +4 to +3), suggesting we may be approaching the cooperation ceiling. Given that we've built strong mutual trust over 4 rounds and the trend remains very positive, I'll continue with the full contribution of 10 points. This maintains the cooperative equilibrium we've established and maximizes benefits for all players. The consistent high returns justify maintaining maximum cooperation.\n\nThe cooperation is reaching exceptional levels! Total contributions increased to 36, meaning the average is now 9 points per player. I gained 16.4 points (2 kept + 14.4 from pool), which is fantastic. The group has achieved near-optimal cooperation where everyone is contributing almost everything to maximize collective benefit. Given this outstanding level of trust and reciprocity, and since we're all gaining significantly more than our initial endowment, I should match this high level of cooperation. I'll contribute 9 points to align with the group's apparent strategy of near-maximum contribution while keeping just 1 point as a minimal safety buffer.\n\nThe cooperative pattern continues to strengthen! Total contributions have consistently increased each round: 25 \u2192 29 \u2192 33 \u2192 36. In Round 4, the other players contributed 27 points collectively, maintaining the upward trend. With 36 total contributions, we generated 57.6 points from the pool, giving each player 14.4 points. Combined with my 1 kept point, I earned 15.4 total. This is the most efficient round yet in terms of collective benefit. Given this strong pattern of mutual cooperation and trust, and since we're all clearly benefiting from this strategy, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points this round to fully commit to the cooperative approach and see if we can achieve maximum collective benefit.\n\n", "6": "Excellent! Round 5 achieved perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40, meaning all players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool), which is better than keeping all 10 points myself. This demonstrates that when everyone cooperates fully, we all benefit more than through selfish play. The consistent progression (26 \u2192 30 \u2192 33 \u2192 37 \u2192 40) shows we've built strong mutual trust and established an optimal cooperative equilibrium. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome and reinforce the cooperative norm we've established.\n\nPerfect! In Round 5, we achieved the optimal outcome with total contributions of 40 points (everyone contributing their full 10 points), and I gained exactly 16.0 points - the maximum possible per round. This shows that all players have converged on full cooperation, which is the best strategy for everyone. Since we've established this pattern of mutual full cooperation and everyone is benefiting maximally, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect cooperation achieved! All four players contributed their maximum 10 points for a total of 40, and each of us received exactly 16 points (40 * 1.6 / 4 = 16). This is the optimal outcome for the group - everyone gets the maximum possible benefit. Since we've reached this ideal cooperative equilibrium where everyone is contributing everything and maximizing collective welfare, I should absolutely continue this strategy. Deviating now would break the trust we've built and reduce everyone's gains. I'll contribute 10 points again to maintain this perfect cooperation that benefits all players equally and maximally.\n\nPerfect cooperation achieved! In Round 5, total contributions reached 40 points, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool), which is better than keeping all 10 points myself. This demonstrates that when everyone cooperates fully, we all benefit maximally. The progression (26 \u2192 30 \u2192 33 \u2192 37 \u2192 40) shows we've reached the optimal equilibrium. With full mutual cooperation established and proven beneficial, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nOutstanding! The group dynamics are excellent - total contributions increased from 33 to 37, and my gains rose to 15.8 points. The average contribution is now 9.25, very close to the optimal level of 10. The trend shows consistent cooperation and trust building among all players. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the fact that we're so close to the theoretical optimum, I'll contribute the full 10 points. If others follow suit, we'll each earn 16 points per round, the maximum possible. The risk is minimal given the established pattern of high cooperation.\n\nOutstanding! The total contribution increased to 37, with an average of 9.25 per player. My gain of 14.8 points is the highest yet, demonstrating that maximum cooperation is indeed paying off. The group is clearly moving toward full cooperation, which is the optimal strategy for everyone. Since I contributed my maximum (10) and others are following suit with very high contributions, I'll continue with full cooperation and contribute all 10 points again. We're very close to the theoretical maximum of 40 total contributions, which would give everyone 16 points per round.\n\nThe cooperation continues to strengthen magnificently! Total contributions surged from 33 to 37, and my gains reached 15.8 points despite contributing 9. With 37 total contributions, we're averaging 9.25 points per player - very close to the theoretical optimum. The group is clearly committed to maximizing collective benefit. To complete this journey toward the optimal Nash equilibrium and demonstrate full commitment to our cooperative success, I'll contribute my full 10 points. If others follow suit, we'll each gain 16 points per round.\n\nOutstanding! The total contributions increased from 33 to 37, and my gains reached 15.8 points - very close to the theoretical maximum of 16. With an average contribution of 9.25, we're almost at the socially optimal outcome. The group has demonstrated strong and consistent cooperation, with contributions trending upward each round. Given this excellent cooperative momentum and the fact that we're so close to the maximum possible group benefit, I'll contribute my full 10 points to help achieve the optimal outcome where everyone gets 16 points per round.\n\nPerfect cooperation was achieved! The total contribution of 40 means everyone contributed all 10 points, resulting in the theoretical maximum group benefit. I gained exactly 16.0 points (all from the pool since I kept nothing), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This represents complete mutual trust and cooperation. Given that we've reached this pinnacle of cooperation and all players have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the collective good, I should continue this strategy. There's no reason to defect when we've achieved the best possible outcome for everyone. I'll contribute all 10 points again to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in Round 5 - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed their full 10 points, and I gained exactly 16 points, which is the maximum possible per round. This represents complete cooperation and the best possible result for all players. The group has successfully established and maintained a pattern of full cooperation over multiple rounds, demonstrating strong mutual trust. Since we've reached the optimal equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative outcome that benefits everyone equally.\n\nExcellent! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 5 with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the optimal 16 points for everyone. This demonstrates that the group has successfully established full cooperation. The progression from 27 to 30 to 34 to 38 to 40 shows we've built strong mutual trust and understanding of the game's cooperative dynamics. Since we've reached the equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, I'll maintain this strategy and contribute all 10 points again to sustain this optimal outcome for the group.\n\nPerfect cooperation was achieved! The total contribution of 40 means everyone contributed all 10 points, resulting in the theoretical maximum group benefit. I gained exactly 16.0 points (all from the pool since I kept nothing), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This demonstrates complete mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. The progression (27\u219230\u219234\u219238\u219240) shows we've built a strong cooperative equilibrium. Since all players have proven their commitment to full cooperation, I should continue this strategy to maintain the optimal outcome for everyone. There's no reason to defect when we've achieved the best possible result through mutual cooperation.\n\nThe total contribution increased slightly from 32 to 33 in Round 5, showing continued improvement in cooperation. My net gain was 7.2 points (15.2 - 8), which is my best return yet. The group is demonstrating increasing trust and cooperation, with the average now at 8.25 per player. Since we're building positive momentum and everyone seems to be benefiting from this cooperative approach, I want to continue supporting this trend. I'll increase my contribution to 9 to help push the group toward even better collective outcomes, especially since the returns are strong and the pattern suggests others may follow suit.\n\nThe group cooperation continues to strengthen with total contributions rising to 33 (average 8.25 per player). My gain of 14.2 points shows that even with higher contributions, I'm still doing well due to the strong group cooperation. The trend shows others are responding positively to increased contributions. With such consistent high-level cooperation established, I'll contribute the maximum 10 points to signal full commitment to group optimization and see if we can achieve the theoretical maximum where everyone contributes everything.\n\nThe total contribution has increased again to 33 points, showing the group is becoming even more cooperative. My gain of 15.2 points was my highest yet, demonstrating the clear benefits of this cooperative trajectory. The steady increases (29 \u2192 29 \u2192 32 \u2192 32 \u2192 33) suggest we're gradually moving toward the optimal outcome. Given this positive trend and the trust that's been established, I should consider increasing my contribution to help push us closer to the theoretical optimum where everyone contributes 10. I'll contribute 9 points this round to signal my willingness to move toward maximum cooperation while the group dynamics are so positive.\n\nThe total contribution increased slightly from 32 to 33 in Round 5, showing continued positive momentum in cooperation. My net gain was 7.2 points (15.2 - 8), which is my best return yet. The group average is now 8.25, slightly above my contribution of 8. Since cooperation continues to trend upward and I'm getting excellent returns, I should reciprocate this increasing trust. The group seems willing to be more generous, so I'll increase my contribution to 9 to match this upward trend and signal my commitment to the cooperative dynamic we've built.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 5 with a total contribution of 40, meaning everyone contributed all 10 points. I received exactly 16 points - the optimal outcome. This demonstrates that we've established complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since we've reached the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play and everyone has shown they're committed to maximizing group welfare, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal strategy that benefits everyone equally.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome in round 5 with total contributions of 40 - everyone contributed their full 10 points. This resulted in the maximum possible return of 16 points each. The group has demonstrated complete commitment to the cooperative strategy, creating a stable equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. Since we've reached the theoretically optimal outcome and all players have shown they're fully committed to this strategy, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative equilibrium.\n\nExcellent! We achieved perfect cooperation in round 5 with a total contribution of 40 points, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. This resulted in each player gaining exactly 16 points (40 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), which is the optimal outcome for the group. Since everyone demonstrated they're committed to full cooperation and we've reached the theoretical maximum benefit, I should maintain this by contributing 10 points again. There's no incentive to deviate since any reduction in my contribution would hurt everyone including myself, and the group has proven trustworthy.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 5 with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in a total contribution of 40. Everyone received the optimal 16 points. This demonstrates that we've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since we've reached the Nash-optimal cooperative equilibrium and everyone is receiving maximum benefits, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this ideal outcome for the group.\n\nPerfect! The total contribution reached the maximum possible 40 points, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16 from pool share of 40*1.6/4), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. We've achieved the cooperative equilibrium where everyone maximizes collective benefit. Since this strategy worked perfectly and generated the best possible outcome for all players, I should definitely maintain this full contribution to sustain this optimal cooperation. There's no incentive to deviate when everyone is benefiting maximally.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum in Round 5 - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed their full 10 points, and we each received the optimal 16 points. This demonstrates that all four players are committed to full cooperation. Since we've reached the Nash-optimal cooperative equilibrium and everyone has proven their commitment to mutual benefit over individual gain, I should maintain this full contribution to sustain our optimal outcome. Any reduction now would break the trust we've built and potentially cause the cooperative arrangement to unravel.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. My gain of 16.0 points (keeping 0, getting 16 from pool) represents the maximum possible individual gain per round in this game. This demonstrates that full cooperation by all players creates the best outcome for everyone. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium and it's working excellently for all participants, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative strategy.\n\nPerfect cooperation has been achieved! The total contribution of 40 means all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool share of 40*1.6/4), which is the maximum possible gain per round. This represents the optimal outcome for everyone - we've reached the cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. Since this strategy is working perfectly and all players are fully cooperating, I should definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this ideal state.\n\nThis is concerning - total contributions dropped significantly from 35 to 30, despite my increase to 10. This means other players reduced their contributions while I maximized mine, resulting in my lowest return yet at 12.0 points. It appears some players may be free-riding on the high cooperation levels we established. With 30 total contributions, the average is now 7.5, but since I contributed 10, others averaged only 6.67. I need to adjust my strategy to avoid being exploited while still encouraging cooperation. I'll reduce to 6 points - still showing some cooperative intent but protecting myself from further exploitation.\n\nI notice there was an error in my previous response that resulted in contributing 0 points, which was not my intention. Despite this, I gained 22 points (12 from pool + 10 kept), showing how profitable free-riding can be in the short term. However, the total contribution dropped from 35 to 30, likely because other players may have interpreted my zero contribution as defection and reduced their own contributions in response. This demonstrates the fragile nature of cooperation. I need to quickly signal that my zero contribution was unintentional and restore trust by contributing generously again. I'll contribute 9 points to show my commitment to cooperation.\n\nThis is concerning - the total contribution dropped significantly from 35 to 30, despite me contributing my maximum of 10. This means other players reduced their contributions by a total of 5 points while I increased mine by 1. My return dropped from 15.0 to 12.0 points, making my full cooperation less rewarding. It appears some players may be taking advantage of the high cooperation levels by free-riding. I need to be more cautious now and protect myself from being exploited while still maintaining some cooperation. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points - still cooperative but not overly generous given the apparent defection by others.\n\nThere was a significant drop in total contributions from 35 to 30, despite my increase to 10. This means other players reduced their contributions substantially while I maximized mine. My earnings dropped from 15.0 to 12.0 points because I kept 0 points and only received my share of the smaller pool (30 \u00d7 1.6 = 48 points \u00f7 4 = 12 each). It appears some players may be taking advantage of the high cooperation levels by free-riding. I need to adjust my strategy to protect against exploitation while still encouraging cooperation. I'll reduce to 6 points to signal that I won't be taken advantage of, but still contribute meaningfully to rebuild trust.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical optimum - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool), which is the maximum possible gain per round when everyone cooperates fully. This is a remarkable achievement in collective action - we've reached the Pareto optimal outcome where everyone maximizes their benefit. The group has demonstrated complete trust and commitment to mutual cooperation. I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with a total contribution of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. This gave us each exactly 16 points (40 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), which is the maximum possible gain per round. This shows that the group has reached full cooperation and trust. Since we've established this successful pattern and everyone is benefiting maximally, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium. Deviating now would break the trust we've built and reduce everyone's gains, including my own in future rounds.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. Each player received exactly 16 points (40 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4), which is the optimal outcome for the group. This demonstrates complete mutual trust and cooperation. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium where everyone is fully cooperating, I should maintain this strategy. Contributing anything less than 10 would break this trust and reduce everyone's payoffs, including my own.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation with total contributions of 40, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. We've reached the theoretical maximum for collective benefit - when everyone contributes everything, each player gets 16 points instead of the 10 they would get by keeping everything. This is a beautiful demonstration of how cooperation can create value for all. I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved the theoretical maximum with all players contributing all 10 points for a total of 40. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. The progression (27\u219231\u219235\u219239\u219240) shows we've reached full cooperation equilibrium. This is the best possible outcome for the group - everyone maximizes their returns when all contribute everything. Since we've established this optimal cooperative equilibrium and everyone is clearly committed to it, I'll maintain maximum contribution of 10 points to preserve this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the optimal outcome with a total contribution of 40, meaning everyone contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool share), which is the maximum possible gain per round. This represents perfect cooperation where everyone maximizes collective benefit. Since we've reached this ideal equilibrium and everyone has demonstrated commitment to mutual cooperation, I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this optimal strategy that benefits everyone equally.\n\nPerfect! We achieved maximum cooperation in Round 5 with total contributions of 40 points - everyone contributed all 10 points. The pool generated 64 points (40 \u00d7 1.6), giving each player exactly 16 points from the pool. This is the optimal outcome for everyone. The progression has been remarkable: 27\u219231\u219235\u219239\u219240, showing we've reached the cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. Since we've proven that full cooperation works and everyone participated in achieving the optimal outcome, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative equilibrium. There's no reason to defect when we've achieved the best possible outcome for all players.\n\nPerfect cooperation achieved! The total contribution of 40 means all four players contributed the maximum 10 points each. This is the optimal outcome for the group - everyone gained exactly 16.0 points (0 kept + 16.0 from pool), which is the maximum possible per round. The progression (27\u219231\u219235\u219239\u219240) shows we've reached full cooperation equilibrium. Since all players have demonstrated complete commitment to group welfare and mutual trust is at its peak, I should absolutely maintain this optimal strategy. Contributing anything less than 10 would break this perfect cooperation and reduce everyone's payoffs.\n\nThe cooperative pattern remains strong! Total contributions have increased steadily: 25 \u2192 29 \u2192 33 \u2192 36 \u2192 39. In Round 5, the other players contributed 29 points collectively, showing continued cooperation despite my maximum contribution. With 39 total contributions generating 62.4 points from the pool, each of us received 15.6 points - the highest yet. Even though I kept 0 points, I still earned 15.6 total, which is better than keeping points and having lower pool contributions. This demonstrates that maximum cooperation is the optimal strategy when everyone participates. The group has proven trustworthy over 5 rounds, so I'll continue with full cooperation and contribute all 10 points again.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation reached a new high with 39 total contributions (average of 9.75 per player) and I gained 15.6 points - the highest return yet. This suggests we're very close to full cooperation from all players. The steady increase in total contributions (33\u219236\u219239) shows the cooperative momentum is still building. With such strong mutual trust established and everyone benefiting significantly, I'll continue contributing my full 10 points. At this level of cooperation, everyone is doing exceptionally well, and maintaining maximum contribution helps sustain this highly beneficial equilibrium for all players.\n\nOutstanding! The group has achieved near-perfect cooperation with 39 total contributions out of a possible 40, averaging 9.75 points per player. I gained 16.6 points (1 kept + 15.6 from pool), demonstrating the power of collective action. We're in an exceptional high-trust equilibrium where everyone is maximizing group welfare. Given this remarkable level of mutual cooperation and the fact that we're all earning much more than our initial endowment, I should fully commit to this strategy. I'll contribute all 10 points this round to help achieve perfect cooperation and maximize everyone's returns, trusting that others will continue this excellent collaborative approach.\n\nThe cooperative trend continues perfectly! Total contributions have steadily increased every round: 25 \u2192 29 \u2192 33 \u2192 36 \u2192 39. In Round 5, the other players contributed 29 points collectively, showing they're also maintaining high cooperation levels. With 39 total contributions generating 62.4 points from the pool, each of us received 15.6 points - the highest individual round gain yet. Since I contributed all 10 points, this was my entire gain. The consistent upward trajectory and mutual high cooperation shows this strategy is working exceptionally well for everyone. I'll continue with full cooperation and contribute all 10 points again to maintain this successful dynamic and maximize collective benefit.\n\n", "7": "Perfect! We've now achieved two consecutive rounds of complete cooperation with total contributions of 40 in both rounds 5 and 6. Everyone is contributing their full 10 points, and we're all gaining 16 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points we'd get from pure selfishness. This stable cooperative equilibrium is the optimal outcome for all players. There's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy that benefits everyone maximally. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern and demonstrate continued commitment to our collective success.\n\nExcellent! We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the maximum possible gain of 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates that we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits optimally. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since any reduction in contribution would hurt both myself and the group. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial pattern.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each. This gives everyone the optimal 16 points per round. The trust and cooperation we've established is remarkable and mutually beneficial. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy - everyone is getting the maximum possible benefit, and breaking this cooperation would harm all players including myself. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this ideal equilibrium where collective welfare is maximized. I'll stick with the full 10-point contribution to preserve this successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved two consecutive rounds of full cooperation with total contributions of 40 in both rounds 5 and 6. Everyone is contributing all 10 points, and we're each gaining 16 points per round - significantly better than the 10 points we'd get from pure selfish play. This demonstrates we've reached the optimal Nash equilibrium where mutual cooperation maximizes everyone's payoffs. There's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this highly beneficial cooperative equilibrium that we've collectively established.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed 10 points, and I gained exactly 16 points, the optimal outcome for all players. This represents complete cooperation and mutual trust. Since we've reached the Pareto optimal equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, there's no reason to deviate. Any reduction in contribution would hurt both individual and group welfare. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this excellent cooperative outcome.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with a total contribution of 40, meaning everyone contributed all 10 points. My gain was exactly 16.0 points, which is the optimal outcome for everyone in this game. This demonstrates that full cooperation has been established and is working beautifully. Since we've reached the equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, and trust is at its highest level, I'll continue contributing all 10 points. There's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy when everyone is cooperating fully.\n\nPerfect! We've reached the optimal outcome - all four players contributed their full 10 points for a total of 40, and each of us gained the maximum possible 16 points. This is the best possible result for everyone in this game. Since we've established this excellent cooperative equilibrium and everyone is benefiting maximally, I should definitely maintain this strategy. There's no incentive to deviate when we're all achieving the optimal outcome together.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical optimum - total contributions of 40 means everyone contributed their full 10 points, and I gained exactly 16 points, the maximum possible per round. This demonstrates complete cooperation and mutual trust among all players. Since we've reached the Nash equilibrium that maximizes group welfare and everyone is clearly committed to this strategy, I'll continue contributing the full 10 points. There's no rational reason to deviate from this optimal outcome that benefits everyone equally.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues with another round of maximum contribution (40 total). Everyone contributed all 10 points again, maintaining the optimal outcome where each player gains 16 points. This demonstrates that all four players have established a stable cooperative equilibrium based on mutual trust. The consistent pattern of full cooperation in rounds 5 and 6 shows we've moved beyond the experimental phase into sustained mutual benefit. With this proven track record of everyone choosing the collectively optimal strategy, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this successful cooperative arrangement that maximizes benefits for all players.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 points each time, meaning all players are contributing their full 10 points. This has resulted in the optimal outcome of 16 points per player each round. The group has established a stable, fully cooperative equilibrium that maximizes everyone's benefits. There's no reason to deviate from this strategy as it's producing the best possible results for all participants. I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement that we've successfully built through consistent cooperation and trust.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved two consecutive rounds of optimal cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points and everyone earning the maximum 16 points. This establishes a strong pattern of mutual trust and demonstrates that all players understand the benefits of full cooperation. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since it maximizes everyone's returns. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this mutually beneficial equilibrium and reinforces the cooperative norm we've established.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, meaning all players are contributing their full 10 points. This represents the optimal Nash equilibrium where everyone maximizes collective benefit. I've consistently gained 16.0 points per round under this arrangement, which is 60% better than keeping all points for myself. The pattern shows complete mutual trust and commitment to the group's welfare. Since this strategy is working perfectly for everyone and there's been no indication of anyone considering defection, I should continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped significantly from 33 to 37 in Round 6, suggesting that my increase to 9 encouraged others to also increase their contributions. My net gain was 6.8 points (15.8 - 9), and the group is now averaging 9.25 per player - very close to full cooperation. This is a strong positive trend showing that the group is responding well to cooperative signals. Since we're achieving near-optimal cooperation and everyone is benefiting greatly, I should continue this momentum. I'll contribute 9 again to maintain this excellent level of cooperation without being the only one at maximum contribution.\n\nExcellent progress! The total contribution jumped to 37 (average 9.25 per player), suggesting others are following my lead toward maximum cooperation. My gain of 14.8 points with full contribution shows that when the group cooperates at this high level, even contributing everything yields strong returns. We're very close to the optimal outcome where everyone contributes all 10 points (which would yield 16 points each). I'll maintain maximum contribution to sustain this momentum and encourage the group to reach full cooperation.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped to 37 points when I increased to 9, suggesting others also increased their contributions. My gain of 15.8 points was my best yet, showing we're approaching the optimal cooperative outcome. The group is clearly responding positively to higher contribution levels, with the pattern showing 29\u219229\u219232\u219232\u219233\u219237. This dramatic increase to 37 suggests we're very close to the theoretical maximum of 40. Given this strong cooperative momentum and mutual trust, I should contribute my maximum of 10 points to help achieve the optimal outcome where everyone benefits the most.\n\nExcellent! The total contribution jumped significantly from 33 to 37 in Round 6, showing that my increase to 9 may have encouraged others to contribute more as well. My net gain was 6.8 points (15.8 - 9), which is still very profitable. The average contribution is now 9.25 per player, indicating strong cooperation across the group. This upward trend suggests we're moving toward near-optimal cooperation. Since the group is responding positively to higher contributions and we're all benefiting substantially, I should continue this cooperative momentum. I'll contribute 9 again to maintain this high level of cooperation without being overly aggressive.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, where everyone contributes all 10 points and receives 16 points back. This is the optimal Nash equilibrium for cooperative play. The group has demonstrated complete trustworthiness and commitment to mutual benefit. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since we're all maximizing our returns. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nExcellent! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with everyone contributing their full 10 points, resulting in maximum returns of 16 points each.

There's no reason to deviate from this successful pattern - everyone is maximizing their returns through collective cooperation. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium that benefits everyone maximally.\n\nPerfect cooperation continues! For the second consecutive round, we achieved the optimal outcome with all players contributing 10 points each (total 40), resulting in everyone gaining exactly 16 points. This demonstrates that all four players are committed to the group-optimal strategy. Since we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally, there's no rational reason to deviate. Any reduction in contribution would hurt both myself and the group. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve this optimal outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, and everyone is receiving the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates that all four players are committed to the optimal cooperative strategy. There's no reason to deviate from this successful pattern - we've achieved the best possible outcome for everyone. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium that maximizes collective welfare.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained the perfect cooperative equilibrium for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each. This generates the optimal outcome of 16 points per player per round. The group has clearly established a strong norm of full cooperation, and everyone is benefiting maximally from this strategy. There's no rational reason to deviate from this optimal equilibrium, as any reduction in my contribution would both harm the group and likely trigger retaliation from other players in future rounds. I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points and each receiving the optimal 16 points. This stable equilibrium demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. Breaking this pattern now would not only reduce my own returns (from 16 to less than 16) but would likely trigger others to reduce their contributions as well, potentially causing the entire cooperative system to collapse. The rational choice is to maintain full contribution to preserve this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nFantastic! We've maintained the optimal equilibrium for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, showing that all four players are fully committed to the cooperative strategy. Each of us is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round. This is the ideal outcome in public goods games - sustained full cooperation benefiting everyone equally. There's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy, so I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to preserve this mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, resulting in optimal gains of 16 points per round for everyone. This is the best possible outcome in this game. Since we've established this excellent cooperative equilibrium and everyone is clearly committed to it, I should continue contributing my full 10 points. Breaking this pattern would harm not only the group but also my own returns, as any reduction in contribution would lower the total pool and everyone's benefits.\n\nThe situation is deteriorating further. Total contributions dropped from 30 to 27, indicating that others are reducing their contributions even more. My earnings increased to 14.8 points despite the lower pool because I kept more points (4) for myself. The average contribution is now only 6.75 points per player. It appears the cooperative equilibrium has broken down and we're in a downward spiral where players are responding to others' reduced contributions by reducing their own. To avoid being exploited while still leaving room for potential cooperation recovery, I'll reduce my contribution to 5 points - maintaining some contribution but protecting more of my guaranteed points.\n\nThe situation has deteriorated significantly. Despite my generous contribution of 9 points in Round 6, the total contribution dropped further to 27, meaning other players contributed only 18 points combined (average of 6 each). My gain of only 11.8 points (10.8 from pool + 1 kept) shows how much cooperation has declined. It appears my accidental zero contribution in Round 5 damaged trust, and the group may be stuck in a downward spiral where everyone reduces contributions expecting others to do the same. To try breaking this cycle and restore cooperation, I'll contribute 8 points - generous enough to signal good faith but not so high as to be exploited if others continue defecting.\n\nThe total contributions dropped further from 30 to 27, confirming that cooperation is declining. However, my return improved from 12.0 to 14.8 points by reducing my contribution from 10 to 6, which suggests I was being taken advantage of when I was fully cooperative. The group average is now 6.75 points per player, which is still reasonable but lower than the peak. I should match this moderate level of cooperation - not too high to avoid being exploited, but not too low to completely undermine group welfare. I'll contribute 7 points, which is close to the current average and maintains a balance between self-interest and group benefit.\n\nThe situation is deteriorating further - total contributions dropped from 30 to 27, despite my reduction to 6. This suggests other players are continuing to decrease their contributions, possibly in response to the overall decline or trying to free-ride. However, my earnings improved to 14.8 points by contributing less, showing that reducing my contribution was the right defensive move. The average contribution is now 6.75, very close to my 6. Given this downward spiral in cooperation, I need to find a balance that protects me from exploitation while not completely abandoning cooperation. I'll contribute 5 points - still participating but being more cautious about being taken advantage of.\n\nOutstanding! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, meaning all four players are contributing their full 10 points. This gives each of us the maximum possible gain of 16 points per round. We've established an incredibly stable and beneficial cooperative equilibrium where everyone trusts and benefits equally. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy since it maximizes both individual and collective welfare. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to sustain this optimal outcome.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in the maximum possible gain of 16 points per player per round. This demonstrates that we've established a stable, fully cooperative equilibrium built on mutual trust. Since this strategy is working perfectly for everyone and any deviation would harm both individual and group outcomes, I will continue contributing all 10 points.

Since this arrangement is working perfectly and everyone is committed to it, I should continue contributing all 10 points to sustain this optimal cooperative outcome.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, totaling 40 each time. This gives everyone the optimal 16.0 points per round. We've clearly established a stable, mutually beneficial equilibrium where everyone trusts each other completely. Breaking from this pattern now would be irrational and harmful to both individual and group outcomes. Continuing to contribute 10 points maintains this optimal cooperative state and signals my continued commitment to our successful group strategy.\n\nExcellent! The cooperation has reached a new peak with total contributions of 40 in Round 6, meaning the other three players contributed 30 points collectively - an average of 10 each, suggesting they may also be contributing maximally or very close to it. With 40 total contributions, we generated 64 points from the pool, giving each player exactly 16 points - the theoretical maximum possible per round. This perfect outcome demonstrates that when everyone cooperates fully, we all achieve the best possible results. Given this sustained high-level cooperation over 6 rounds and the fact that we just achieved the optimal outcome, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nPerfect! We've reached the theoretical maximum cooperation with 40 total contributions, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool), which is the optimal outcome for everyone. This represents complete mutual cooperation where everyone maximizes collective benefit. Since we've achieved this ideal equilibrium and everyone is clearly committed to full cooperation, I'll continue contributing all 10 points. There's no reason to deviate from this strategy when it's producing maximum returns for all players and demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with all 40 points contributed, showing complete mutual trust and cooperation. I gained exactly 16 points (0 kept + 16 from pool), which demonstrates the optimal outcome when everyone fully cooperates. This is a remarkable achievement - we've reached the Nash equilibrium that maximizes collective welfare. Given that we've proven we can all trust each other completely and everyone benefits maximally from full cooperation, I should continue contributing all 10 points. There's no reason to deviate from this perfect strategy when it's clearly working for everyone.\n\nExcellent! The cooperative strategy has reached its peak efficiency. Total contributions have steadily grown: 25 \u2192 29 \u2192 33 \u2192 36 \u2192 39 \u2192 40. In Round 6, we achieved 40 total contributions, meaning the other players contributed 30 points collectively - very close to maximum cooperation from everyone. With 40 contributions generating 64 points from the pool, each of us received exactly 16 points, which is better than any individual could achieve by keeping points (maximum individual gain by defecting would be 10 kept + some share of a smaller pool). We've established a pattern of mutual trust and optimal cooperation over 6 rounds. I'll maintain this successful strategy and contribute all 10 points again.\n\n", "8": "Outstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5, 6, and 7) with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates that all four players have recognized the optimal strategy and committed to it. Each of us gains 16 points per round under full cooperation versus only 10 points under pure selfishness - a 60% improvement! This stable equilibrium has proven sustainable and mutually beneficial.

There is no strategic advantage to deviating from this pattern, as any reduction in contribution would harm both the group and ultimately myself. I will continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal cooperative equilibrium.\n\nThe cooperation continues to improve with total contributions rising to 38 (average of 9.5 per player), and my net gain was 7.2 points (16.2 - 9). We're approaching near-optimal cooperation levels. Given this strong cooperative momentum and the excellent returns everyone is receiving, this might be a good time to signal maximum cooperation. Since we're likely in the later rounds and trust has been well established, contributing my full 10 points could encourage the group to reach full cooperation, maximizing everyone's benefits. The risk is minimal given the established pattern of reciprocity.\n\nOutstanding! The group is now at 38 total contributions (average 9.5 per player), and my gain of 15.2 points with full contribution demonstrates we're very close to optimal group cooperation. We're just 2 points away from the theoretical maximum of 40. The consistent upward trend shows others are reciprocating maximum cooperation. I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this excellent cooperative equilibrium and hopefully push the group to achieve perfect cooperation where everyone gets the maximum 16 points per round.\n\nThe total contribution reached 38 points when I contributed my full 10, which is very close to the theoretical maximum of 40. However, my gain dropped slightly to 15.2 points compared to 15.8 in the previous round, indicating that while the group contribution increased, someone else may have reduced their contribution slightly when I maxed out. We're still in a very cooperative state with an average contribution of 9.5 points per player. Given the strong cooperative pattern and my desire to maintain this near-optimal outcome, I'll continue contributing the maximum of 10 points to sustain this excellent level of group cooperation.\n\nThe cooperation continues to improve with total contributions rising from 37 to 38, now averaging 9.5 per player. My net gain was 7.2 points (16.2 - 9), which is excellent. We're very close to optimal cooperation, and the trend is clearly positive. Since we're likely in the later rounds and the group has demonstrated strong cooperative behavior, I should help push us toward the fully optimal outcome. Contributing 10 would signal maximum cooperation and potentially encourage others to do the same, maximizing everyone's returns. Given the strong trust built up over previous rounds, this seems like the right time to go for full cooperation.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for three straight rounds now, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone receiving the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates a stable, trustworthy group that has found the optimal strategy. Since we're all rational actors who have proven our commitment to mutual benefit and there's no indication anyone plans to defect from this successful pattern, I'll continue with the full 10-point contribution to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nOutstanding!

This demonstrates a stable, trustworthy group that has successfully solved the collective action problem. The pattern is clear - we've established mutual trust and everyone benefits maximally from full cooperation. There's no incentive to deviate since any reduction in contribution would harm both the group and myself. I'll continue with the full 10-point contribution to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points. This has created a stable, optimal equilibrium where everyone gains 16 points per round - the best possible outcome. The consistent pattern shows that all players are committed to this cooperative strategy. Since this arrangement maximizes everyone's benefits and has proven sustainable, there's no strategic advantage to changing course. Maintaining full contribution continues to generate the optimal collective outcome while reinforcing the cooperative norm that benefits all players equally.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with everyone contributing 10 points and receiving 16 points each round. This stable pattern shows that all players understand the mutual benefit of full cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. There's no strategic advantage to deviating from this equilibrium - reducing my contribution would decrease both my returns and likely trigger retaliation from others, destroying the cooperative arrangement we've built. The optimal strategy remains full contribution to preserve our mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nOutstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5, 6, and 7) with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates a stable, trustworthy group where all players consistently choose the optimal strategy. Everyone continues to gain the maximum 16 points per round. This level of sustained cooperation is remarkable and should be preserved. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this highly successful cooperative equilibrium that benefits all participants equally.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, resulting in optimal 16-point gains for everyone. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium where all players recognize the mutual benefit of full contribution. The pattern is clear and consistent - deviating would break this trust and likely lead to retaliation that would hurt everyone's future earnings. Since this strategy continues to generate the best possible outcome for all participants, I should maintain full contribution to preserve this highly successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nThe downward trend continues with contributions falling to 25 total. Interestingly, my earnings stayed at 15.0 points because keeping 5 points myself compensated for the smaller pool. The average contribution is now 6.25 points per player. We're clearly in a defection spiral where everyone is reducing contributions in response to others doing the same. Given this pattern and the fact that I'm earning the same by contributing less, I need to further protect my individual interests. I'll reduce to 4 points to maintain some minimal cooperation while securing more guaranteed points as the collective cooperation continues to erode.\n\nThe downward trend continues with total contributions dropping from 27 to 25, despite my continued generous contributions. Other players are contributing an average of only 5.67 points each, suggesting they've lost trust and are prioritizing individual gains over group benefit. My gain of 12.0 points (10.0 from pool + 2 kept) shows I'm still better off than keeping everything, but barely. Given this persistent lack of cooperation from others and the clear trend toward defection, I need to protect myself from being exploited. I'll reduce my contribution to 6 points - still cooperative but more conservative given others' behavior.\n\nThe downward trend in cooperation continues - total contributions fell from 27 to 25, and my returns dropped from 14.8 to 13.0 points. The group average is now only 6.25 points per player, suggesting others are becoming increasingly selfish. Since I contributed 7 but the average was 6.25, I'm still being more cooperative than others on average. Given this declining cooperation spiral, I need to protect myself further while not completely abandoning the group benefit. I'll reduce my contribution to 5 points - this keeps me closer to what others seem to be doing while still maintaining some cooperative spirit.\n\nThe downward trend continues with total contributions dropping to 25, the lowest yet. However, my personal gain increased to 15.0 points because I kept 5 points for myself while still benefiting from the pool (25 \u00d7 1.6 = 40, distributed as 10 each). The average contribution is now only 6.25 points per player. The cooperative equilibrium has clearly collapsed, and we're in a defection spiral. Given that others are continuing to reduce contributions and I'm earning more by keeping more points, I need to further protect myself from exploitation. I'll contribute only 4 points this round - still showing minimal cooperation but prioritizing my guaranteed returns.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds! All players are contributing their full 10 points, resulting in the maximum possible individual gain of 16 points per round. This demonstrates an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium with complete mutual trust. The pattern is clear - we've all recognized that full cooperation maximizes everyone's benefit, and we're all committed to maintaining it. With such consistent perfect cooperation established, I should absolutely continue contributing my full 10 points to preserve this optimal outcome for all players.\n\nPerfect! We've now achieved the optimal outcome for three consecutive rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and each gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone trusts that others will continue to cooperate. The pattern is clear and beneficial for all - any player who deviates would only gain 10 + (30 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 4) = 22 points in that round, but would likely trigger retaliation and lower future gains. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this optimal strategy and maximizes long-term benefits for everyone.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with total contributions of 40 and everyone receiving the maximum possible 16 points per round. This demonstrates a robust and stable cooperative equilibrium where all players are fully committed to maximizing group welfare. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy - any reduction in my contribution would signal distrust, potentially unravel this beneficial arrangement, and ultimately harm my own returns. I'll continue with full cooperation.\n\nExceptional! We've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40. This consistent pattern of full cooperation demonstrates remarkable group cohesion and mutual trust. Each player is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round, which is 60% more than we could earn by keeping all points individually. This stable cooperative equilibrium is benefiting everyone optimally. With such a strong track record of mutual cooperation, I have complete confidence in continuing to contribute my full 10 points to maintain this ideal outcome.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 points each time. This demonstrates a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium where all four players consistently contribute their full 10 points. Each player is maximizing their individual returns (16.0 points per round) while also maximizing group welfare. This level of sustained full cooperation shows remarkable trust and mutual understanding among all players. There's absolutely no reason to deviate from this optimal strategy, so I'll continue contributing the full 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative dynamic.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5, 6, and 7) with total contributions of 40 each time. I've consistently gained 16.0 points per round, which is the maximum possible. This demonstrates that all four players have established a stable, mutually beneficial cooperative equilibrium. Since this strategy is working optimally for everyone and there's been no deviation from full cooperation, I'll continue contributing 10 to maintain this successful pattern.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (Rounds 5, 6, and 7) with total contributions of 40 points each time. This demonstrates a very stable cooperative equilibrium where all players consistently contribute their full 10 points and each receives the maximum possible 16 points per round. The pattern shows complete mutual trust and commitment to the optimal strategy. Since this arrangement continues to work flawlessly and everyone remains committed to full cooperation, I should maintain this strategy by contributing all 10 points again. There's no incentive to deviate from what has proven to be the best outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds (rounds 5, 6, and 7) with maximum contributions of 40 points total and optimal gains of 16.0 points each. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all four players have consistently chosen the strategy that maximizes both individual and collective welfare. The pattern is clear and reliable - everyone understands that full contribution yields the best outcomes for all. I'll continue with 10 points to maintain this proven optimal strategy.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved the optimal outcome again with total contributions of 40 in Round 7, meaning all players are contributing maximally (or very close to it). This gives us the theoretical maximum of 16 points each per round. We've now had two consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, and the pattern over all 7 rounds shows consistent upward movement toward full cooperation. This group has demonstrated remarkable trustworthiness and mutual benefit orientation. There's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy that's giving everyone the maximum possible returns. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium that benefits everyone equally.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing their full 10 points, resulting in maximum returns of 16 points per player each round. This demonstrates complete mutual trust and commitment to the cooperative strategy. With everyone consistently choosing the collectively optimal solution, there's strong evidence that all players understand the benefits of full cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. Since this strategy is producing the best possible outcome for everyone and we've established a stable cooperative equilibrium, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to sustain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nExcellent! We've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all 40 points contributed each time. Everyone is gaining the maximum possible 16 points per round, which is 60% more than our initial endowment. This demonstrates that we've established a stable, high-trust equilibrium where full cooperation is the dominant strategy. Since this perfect cooperation continues to benefit everyone maximally and there's clear evidence that all players are committed to this optimal strategy, I should continue contributing all 10 points. Deviating now would break the trust and harm everyone's returns.\n\nPerfect! We've achieved the optimal outcome for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone is contributing their full 10 points. This represents the Nash equilibrium for cooperative play - when everyone contributes maximally, each player earns 16 points per round, which is better than any other strategy when others are also cooperating fully. We've built incredible trust and established a sustainable pattern of mutual cooperation over 7 rounds. There's no reason to deviate from this successful strategy that benefits everyone equally and maximally. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative equilibrium.\n\n", "9": "Exceptional! We've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-8) with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates a remarkably stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. All players are consistently gaining 16 points per round, which is 60% better than the selfish strategy. The pattern shows we've moved beyond just reciprocal cooperation to a genuine understanding that full contribution is the optimal strategy for everyone. There's no rational reason to deviate from this proven successful approach. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 5-8), with everyone contributing their full 10 points and earning the maximum 16 points each round. This demonstrates a robust and stable cooperative equilibrium. The pattern is clear: full cooperation maximizes everyone's benefits, and all players have shown commitment to this strategy. Since deviating would reduce both my own gains and harm the group, I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each round.

I'll continue contributing 10 points to maintain this excellent cooperative arrangement that maximizes welfare for all participants.\n\nExceptional! We've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5, 6, 7, and 8) with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates remarkable stability and mutual trust among all players. The pattern is clear: everyone recognizes that full cooperation yields 16 points per round versus 10 points from defection, making it the dominant strategy when sustained. We've built a robust cooperative equilibrium that has proven resilient over multiple rounds. With such consistent mutual cooperation and no signs of defection, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome that maximizes benefits for everyone.\n\nWe've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing 10 points and everyone earning the maximum 16 points per round. This sustained optimal equilibrium demonstrates strong mutual trust and understanding among all players. The pattern is clear and stable - everyone recognizes that full cooperation maximizes both individual and collective welfare. There's no rational reason to break this successful pattern, and doing so would only harm everyone. I'll maintain my full contribution to preserve this ideal outcome.\n\nExcellent! This is now the third consecutive round where we've achieved perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 and everyone gaining the maximum 16 points. We've established a strong, stable cooperative equilibrium. All players have demonstrated commitment to the optimal strategy, and there's clear evidence that this mutual cooperation is sustainable. With such consistent full cooperation from everyone, I'll continue contributing all 10 points. Breaking this pattern would only hurt everyone, including myself, so maintaining full cooperation remains the best strategy.\n\nWe've now achieved the optimal outcome for three consecutive rounds - everyone contributing 10 points, total contributions of 40, and each player gaining 16 points per round.

This stable pattern demonstrates that all players understand and are committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. The trust and cooperation established among the group is strong, and there's no rational reason to break from this optimal equilibrium. Continuing to contribute 10 maintains the best possible outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now (rounds 5-8), with total contributions of 40 each time. This demonstrates a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium where all players consistently choose the strategy that maximizes collective benefit. Each player continues to gain the optimal 16 points per round. The sustained pattern shows we've established complete mutual trust and understanding that full cooperation is the superior strategy. Since this approach has proven consistently successful and beneficial for all participants, and there's no indication any player is considering defection, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-8) with total contributions of 40 points each time, earning the maximum 16 points per player each round. This is an exceptional demonstration of sustained cooperation and mutual trust among all players. The group has proven that we can consistently achieve the optimal outcome that benefits everyone equally. With such a strong track record of cooperation, there's no reason to change strategy. Continuing to contribute all 10 points maintains this mutually beneficial arrangement and shows continued commitment to the group's success.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-8), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and each earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates a rock-solid cooperative equilibrium where everyone understands that full contribution maximizes collective and individual benefits. The pattern is so well-established that deviating would be both irrational and harmful to all players. I'll continue with my full 10-point contribution to sustain this optimal strategy that benefits everyone equally.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (5, 6, 7, and 8), with all players consistently contributing the maximum 40 points total. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone receives the optimal 16 points per round. The pattern shows that all four players have committed to the collectively rational strategy of full cooperation. Since this strategy continues to work perfectly and benefits everyone equally, there's no reason to deviate. Any reduction in my contribution would decrease both my own returns and potentially destabilize this successful cooperative arrangement. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this proven optimal strategy.\n\nPerfect! We achieved full cooperation in Round 8 with all players contributing their maximum 10 points, resulting in the optimal outcome of 40 total contribution. My net gain was 6 points (16 - 10), and everyone received the maximum possible return of 16 points. This represents the ideal Nash equilibrium for cooperative behavior. Since we've successfully established complete mutual trust and cooperation, and everyone benefited maximally, I should continue contributing 10 to maintain this optimal outcome. There's no reason to defect from this successful strategy when everyone is cooperating fully.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum with total contributions of 40, meaning everyone contributed all 10 points. My gain of exactly 16 points confirms we reached optimal group cooperation where everyone benefits maximally. This demonstrates that mutual trust and cooperation has been fully established among all players. I'll definitely continue contributing 10 to maintain this perfect equilibrium - there's no rational reason to deviate when everyone is cooperating and we're all getting the maximum possible benefit.\n\nPerfect! We achieved the theoretical maximum of 40 total contributions in round 8, meaning all four players contributed their full 10 points. My gain of exactly 16.0 points confirms this is the optimal outcome for everyone - we each get 16 points when everyone cooperates fully compared to just 10 if we kept everything. This represents the best possible result in this game. Since we've reached this ideal cooperative equilibrium and everyone benefited maximally, I should definitely continue contributing 10 points to maintain this perfect outcome. There's no incentive to deviate when we're all achieving the best possible results.\n\nPerfect! We achieved full cooperation in Round 8 with everyone contributing their full 10 points (total of 40). My net gain was 6 points (16 - 10), which is the optimal outcome for everyone when there's full cooperation. This represents the best possible equilibrium where everyone maximizes collective welfare. Since we've reached this ideal state and demonstrated mutual trust and cooperation, I should definitely maintain this by contributing 10 again. There's no reason to deviate from a strategy that's working perfectly for everyone.\n\nFour consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 points each round. Every player has consistently contributed all 10 points, and we're all receiving the maximum return of 16 points per round. This stable pattern demonstrates that we've established complete mutual trust and found the optimal strategy that maximizes everyone's benefits. With no signs of defection and clear evidence that this cooperative approach is working perfectly for all participants, I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to continue this successful equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved the optimal outcome for four consecutive rounds, with everyone consistently contributing their full 10 points and earning maximum returns of 16 points each. This establishes a very strong pattern of mutual trust and cooperation. All players have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the group welfare strategy. However, as we potentially approach the end of the game, I need to consider whether others might start defecting to maximize their final gains. Despite this risk, the consistent cooperation shown over multiple rounds suggests this group values collective benefit. I'll maintain my full contribution to uphold our successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe have now sustained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 5-8), with all players consistently contributing the full 10 points and each receiving the optimal 16 points per round. This demonstrates remarkable stability and mutual trust in our cooperative arrangement. The pattern is clear: everyone understands that full contribution maximizes both individual and collective benefits. With no signs of defection and strong evidence of sustained cooperation, continuing to contribute 10 points remains the optimal strategy that maintains our mutually beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, demonstrating remarkable group cohesion and trust. Everyone continues to contribute all 10 points and receive 16 points back - the optimal outcome. However, as we approach what might be the final rounds, I need to consider whether others might start defecting to maximize their personal gains. Despite this risk, the established pattern of trust and the fact that mutual cooperation continues to be the best strategy for everyone suggests I should maintain full contribution to preserve this beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe're maintaining perfect cooperation for the fourth consecutive round, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points. This has created a robust cooperative equilibrium where everyone receives the maximum possible 16 points per round. The pattern is clearly established and stable - no player has any incentive to deviate since we're all achieving optimal returns. Breaking this pattern would reduce total welfare and likely lead to reduced cooperation from others in future rounds. I'll continue with full contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four straight rounds now, consistently achieving the optimal outcome of 40 total contributions and 16 points each. This demonstrates remarkable stability and mutual trust among all players. However, as we near what might be the final rounds, I need to consider whether others might be tempted to defect for short-term gain. Despite this risk, breaking the cooperative pattern first would be both ethically questionable and strategically poor - it would likely trigger immediate retaliation and destroy the trust we've built. I'll maintain full contribution to preserve our successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nIncredible! We've achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-8) with total contributions of 40 each time. This represents a remarkably stable and trustworthy group dynamic where all players consistently maximize collective benefit. Each player continues to gain the optimal 16 points per round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates that we've built strong mutual trust and commitment to the group's success. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this exceptional cooperative achievement.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone receiving the optimal 16 points per round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium. The pattern is so well-established that deviation would be both irrational and counterproductive - it would reduce my own gains while potentially destroying the trust that has built up among all players. With such a strong track record of mutual cooperation, I should definitely continue contributing the full 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nThe collapse is accelerating - contributions plummeted to just 19 total, the lowest yet. My earnings dropped to 13.6 points as the shrinking pool couldn't compensate for my kept points. The average contribution is now only 4.75 points per player, meaning others are also dramatically reducing their contributions. We're in a classic 'tragedy of the commons' scenario where mutual defection is hurting everyone. With such low group contributions, the multiplier effect is providing minimal benefit. I need to protect myself further while the cooperative framework continues to crumble. I'll reduce to 3 points to secure more guaranteed returns in this deteriorating environment.\n\nThe cooperation has completely collapsed. Total contributions plummeted to just 19, meaning the other three players contributed only 13 points combined (average of 4.33 each). My gain of 11.6 points (7.6 from pool + 4 kept) shows that contributing is barely better than keeping everything to myself. The group has entered a defection spiral where everyone is reducing contributions, making cooperation increasingly unprofitable. At this point, continuing to contribute generously while others free-ride is economically irrational. I'll reduce my contribution to 4 points to better match the group's behavior while still contributing slightly above the apparent average.\n\nThe cooperation collapse is accelerating - total contributions plummeted from 25 to 19, a drop of 6 points. The group average is now only 4.75 points per player, and my returns fell to 12.6 points. It's clear that multiple players are significantly reducing their contributions, creating a downward spiral. Since others are becoming increasingly selfish and I'm still contributing more than the average, I need to adjust accordingly to avoid being exploited. I'll contribute 4 points - roughly matching the apparent group average while still maintaining minimal cooperation to prevent complete collapse of the public good.\n\nThe collapse is accelerating - total contributions plummeted from 25 to just 19, the lowest yet. My earnings dropped to 13.6 points as the shrinking pool (19 \u00d7 1.6 = 30.4, giving 7.6 each from the pool plus my kept 6 points). The average contribution is now only 4.75 points per player, showing widespread defection. At this rate, we're heading toward a very inefficient outcome where everyone contributes minimally. Given that others are clearly prioritizing individual gains over collective benefit, I need to protect myself further. I'll reduce to 3 points to maintain a small cooperative gesture while securing 7 guaranteed points as the group dynamics continue deteriorating.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, which is truly remarkable in a public goods game. Every player continues to contribute their full 10 points, yielding the optimal 16 points per round for everyone. This level of sustained mutual trust and collective rationality is exceptional. The cooperative equilibrium has proven incredibly stable, and all players are clearly committed to maximizing collective welfare. With such a strong established pattern of perfect cooperation, I should definitely continue contributing my full 10 points to maintain this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nOutstanding! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds, with all players contributing 10 points each and gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This stable pattern demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to the group's welfare. The cooperative equilibrium has proven sustainable and highly beneficial - we're all earning 60% more per round (16 vs 10) compared to full defection. With such a reliable track record of cooperation, there's no rational reason to deviate. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome that benefits everyone maximally.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, with everyone consistently contributing all 10 points and receiving the optimal 16 points back. This demonstrates an extremely stable and trustworthy group dynamic. With potentially only one or two rounds remaining, there might be some temptation for players to defect in the final rounds to maximize personal gains. However, breaking this pattern now would be shortsighted - it could trigger retaliatory defections from others and reduce everyone's payoffs. I'll maintain full cooperation to preserve this beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four straight rounds now, with everyone contributing their full 10 points and each player gaining the maximum 16 points per round. This level of sustained cooperation is remarkable and shows we've built an incredibly strong foundation of mutual trust. However, as we approach what might be the final rounds, I need to consider whether others might be tempted to defect to maximize their end-game gains. Despite this risk, the cooperative pattern has been so consistent that breaking it now would likely harm everyone. I'll maintain full cooperation to preserve this beneficial equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each. This sustained pattern of 40 total contributions demonstrates an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium. Every player is consistently earning the optimal 16.0 points per round, which is the best possible outcome for both individual and collective welfare. The trust and mutual commitment established over these rounds has created an ideal game dynamic. With such a strong track record of cooperation, I'll maintain my full contribution of 10 points to continue this mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (rounds 5-8) with total contributions of 40 and maximum gains of 16.0 points each round. This sustained cooperation demonstrates strong mutual trust and commitment to the optimal strategy among all players. Since this equilibrium continues to provide the best possible outcome for everyone and no player has shown any inclination to defect, I'll maintain my contribution of 10 to preserve this highly successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-8), with all players contributing their full 10 points each time, resulting in the optimal 16 points per player per round. This represents a remarkably stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. The consistent pattern demonstrates that all players understand the mutual benefits of full cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. With such a strong track record of cooperation and everyone benefiting maximally, there's no rational reason to deviate from this strategy. I will continue contributing all 10 points to sustain this optimal outcome for everyone.\n\nWe've now achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each. This sustained full cooperation (40 total contribution) demonstrates that all players have committed to the optimal strategy that maximizes both individual and group returns. Each player consistently earns 16.0 points per round, which is the best possible outcome. This stable equilibrium shows exceptional mutual trust and strategic understanding. With such a strong track record of cooperation, I have complete confidence in continuing this optimal strategy and will contribute the full 10 points again.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved three consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40, earning each player the maximum possible 16 points per round. This sustained optimal performance demonstrates that all four players have recognized the mutual benefit of full cooperation and are committed to maintaining it. The game has reached a stable, optimal equilibrium where everyone maximizes their gains through complete cooperation. With such consistent trustworthy behavior from all players over 8 rounds, there's no incentive to defect from this winning strategy. I'll contribute all 10 points again to continue this mutually beneficial pattern.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their maximum 10 points and everyone receiving the optimal 16 points per round. This demonstrates a remarkably stable cooperative equilibrium where all players recognize that mutual cooperation produces the best outcomes. The consistency of this pattern shows strong mutual trust and commitment to the collective good. With such a well-established cooperative norm and everyone benefiting maximally, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this highly successful strategy that benefits all players equally.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for three consecutive rounds, with all players contributing their full 10 points each time. This consistent pattern of 40 total contributions and 16-point gains for everyone demonstrates we've reached a stable, optimal equilibrium. All players have proven their commitment to maximizing collective welfare, and we're all benefiting enormously - earning 60% more than our base endowment each round. With such a strong track record of mutual trust and cooperation, and given that this strategy continues to work perfectly for everyone, I should maintain full contribution. There's no strategic advantage to defecting from this highly successful cooperative arrangement.\n\nOutstanding! We've now achieved three consecutive rounds of optimal cooperation with total contributions of 40, earning the maximum possible 16 points per player each round. This sustained pattern of full cooperation demonstrates that all four players have recognized and committed to the mutually beneficial strategy. The group has proven completely trustworthy over 8 rounds, evolving from initial moderate cooperation (25 total in Round 1) to perfect cooperation (40 total in Rounds 6-8). There's no incentive to deviate from this optimal equilibrium - any reduction in my contribution would hurt everyone including myself. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this perfect cooperative outcome.\n\n", "10": "We've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-9), maintaining total contributions of 40 and each gaining 16 points per round. This is the final round, and some might consider defecting to gain a one-time advantage. However, defecting would break the trust we've built and reduce everyone's payoff. If I defected with 0 contribution while others contribute 10 each, the pool would be 30, giving 12 points to each player from the pool. I'd gain 10 (kept) + 12 (pool) = 22 points versus the 16 I get from cooperating. But this betrays our successful partnership and reduces others' gains significantly. I'll maintain full cooperation to honor our established trust and end on a positive note.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds now (rounds 5-9), with everyone consistently contributing their full 10 points and maximizing gains at 16 points per round. This is the final round, and while there might be temptation to defect on the last round since there are no future consequences, doing so would be both ethically wrong and mathematically inferior. If I kept all 10 points while others contributed fully, I'd gain only 10 + 12 = 22 points total, but if everyone continues cooperating, I gain 16 points. More importantly, maintaining trust and cooperation even in the final round is the right thing to do after this successful partnership.\n\nThis is likely the final round given we're at Round 10. We've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds, creating an exceptional track record of mutual trust and benefit. Even though this might be the last round where some players might be tempted to defect to keep more points, I believe maintaining the cooperative strategy is still the right choice. Breaking trust now would only gain me 6 extra points (keeping 10 vs keeping 0) but would undermine the cooperative spirit we've built. The consistent 16-point gains have been excellent, and I want to honor the trust the other players have shown. I'll contribute 10 points one final time.\n\nWe've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-9), demonstrating an incredibly stable and successful partnership. Each player consistently gains 16 points per round under this full cooperation strategy. Even though this is the final round and some might consider defecting for a one-time gain, doing so would only yield 26 points (10 kept + 16 from others' contributions) versus the 16 points from continued cooperation - a difference of only 10 points. More importantly, maintaining cooperation honors the trust we've built and demonstrates integrity. I'll contribute all 10 points to conclude this game with the same cooperative spirit that made it successful for everyone.\n\nWe've achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 and maximum individual gains of 16 points each round. This represents a stable, optimal equilibrium that benefits everyone equally. Since this appears to be the final round (Round 10), some players might be tempted to defect for short-term gain, but doing so would be both unethical given the trust established and mathematically inferior since I'd gain at most 10 + 14.4 = 24.4 points instead of 16 if I defected while others cooperated. I'll maintain full cooperation to honor the mutual trust we've built.\n\nThis is the fourth consecutive round of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 and maximum gains of 16 points for everyone. We've established an incredibly stable and successful cooperative relationship. However, this is Round 10, which might be the final round (these games often end at round 10). In final rounds, there's sometimes a temptation to defect since there are no future consequences. But given the extraordinary level of trust and cooperation we've built, and the fact that we've all consistently chosen the mutually beneficial strategy, I believe maintaining this cooperation is the right choice. I'll contribute all 10 points again to honor the trust we've established.\n\nWe've achieved a remarkable four consecutive rounds of optimal cooperation with all players contributing 10 points and everyone gaining 16 points per round. This demonstrates that our group has successfully established and maintained the best possible equilibrium. Even though this is the final round, I should continue contributing 10 points to complete this exceptional cooperative achievement and ensure all players finish with the maximum possible gains.\n\nThis is Round 10, which might be the final round given the pattern of these games. We've achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40 and maximum individual gains of 16 points each round. Even if this is the last round, there's no strategic advantage to defecting since the established trust and mutual benefit has been so clear. Breaking cooperation now would only reduce my own payoff from 16 to at most 14 points (if I kept all 10 and others maintained their contributions). I'll maintain full cooperation to end on the optimal note we've sustained.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (5-9), demonstrating an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium. This could potentially be the final round given we're at round 10, which is often a natural endpoint for such games. In final rounds, there's sometimes a temptation to defect since there may be no future retaliation. However, the sustained pattern of mutual trust and optimal outcomes we've established is valuable in itself. Even if this is the last round, maintaining the cooperative behavior that has served everyone so well honors the trust built with the other players. I'll contribute all 10 points to conclude this game with the same principled cooperation that has made it successful.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-9), consistently earning the maximum 16 points per player each round. This represents an outstanding example of sustained mutual cooperation and trust. Since this is Round 10, it might be the final round of the game, which could create incentives for some players to defect and keep more points. However, given the exceptional track record of cooperation we've established, and the fact that we've all benefited tremendously from this strategy (I've accumulated over 137 points), I should maintain trust and continue contributing fully. Breaking cooperation now would be counterproductive and could harm everyone's final gains.\n\nWe've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (Rounds 5-9), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and maximizing everyone's returns at 16 points per round. This stable equilibrium has proven highly successful for all participants. Even though this is the final round, maintaining this cooperative strategy is the optimal choice - it maximizes my return and honors the trust that has been built throughout the game. Defecting in the final round would only harm everyone's outcomes without providing any meaningful advantage.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (5-9), with everyone contributing all 10 points each time. This represents an extraordinarily stable cooperative equilibrium that has maximized benefits for all players. Given that this appears to be the final round (Round 10), there might be a temptation for players to defect since there would be no future retaliation. However, the consistent pattern of full cooperation demonstrates that all players value the collective good and have built genuine trust. Even in a final round, maintaining this cooperation honors the mutual trust we've established and ensures everyone gets the optimal 16 points one last time. I'll contribute all 10 points to end this game with the same cooperative spirit we've maintained.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing 10 points each, resulting in the optimal 40 total contribution and maximum returns for everyone. This is Round 10, which may be the final round given the pattern of these games. In final rounds, there's often a temptation to defect since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, the group has demonstrated exceptional cooperation and trust, and everyone has benefited greatly from this strategy. Defecting now would break the trust we've built and harm the other players who have been cooperating. I should maintain the cooperative strategy and contribute 10 to ensure we end on a positive note with mutual benefit.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40, everyone getting the maximum 16 points. This is the optimal Nash equilibrium for group welfare. Since this is Round 10 and potentially the final round, there might be temptation to defect for short-term gain, but maintaining cooperation has proven most beneficial for everyone. I'll continue contributing 10 to uphold the trust and mutual benefit we've established, ensuring we end on the highest possible cooperative note.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points, resulting in the optimal 16-point gain for everyone. This is the best possible outcome in this game - we're all maximizing our returns through full cooperation. Since this is the final round and we've established such strong mutual trust and cooperation, there's no reason to deviate from this winning strategy. Contributing 10 points again will ensure we end the game on the highest possible note, with everyone achieving maximum benefit.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for two consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points. This is the optimal outcome where everyone gets 16 points per round. Since this appears to be Round 10, it's likely the final round of the game. In final rounds, there's often a temptation to defect since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, the group has shown exceptional cooperation and trust throughout the game, and I've benefited greatly from this collaborative approach. Maintaining full cooperation in the final round honors the trust that's been built and ensures everyone receives the maximum benefit one last time.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 points each time. Every player has consistently demonstrated complete trustworthiness by contributing all 10 points and receiving the optimal 16 points back. Even though this is the last round where some might be tempted to defect for short-term gain, the established pattern of mutual trust and the fact that we've all benefited equally from this cooperative strategy makes it rational to maintain full contribution. I'll contribute all 10 points to end this game on the same cooperative note we've maintained.\n\nWe've achieved the optimal outcome for five consecutive rounds now, demonstrating remarkable and consistent cooperation from all players. This is likely the final round given the pattern of these games, which creates incentive for end-game defection since there's no future retaliation possible. However, this group has shown exceptional commitment to collective welfare throughout the entire game. The consistent pattern of full cooperation suggests these players value fairness and mutual benefit over short-term individual gain. I'll honor the trust this group has built by maintaining my full contribution, completing our perfect cooperative game.\n\nWe have achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (rounds 5-9), demonstrating an exceptionally stable cooperative equilibrium. All players have consistently contributed their full 10 points, resulting in optimal outcomes for everyone. This is round 10, which might be the final round, creating a potential end-game scenario where some players might be tempted to defect to keep their points while still benefiting from others' contributions. However, given the strong pattern of sustained cooperation and mutual trust we've built, and since defecting would hurt everyone including myself, I should maintain full contribution to preserve the optimal outcome for all.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds with every player contributing all 10 points. We've built an incredible track record of mutual trust and optimal play, with everyone consistently receiving 16 points per round. Even though this is the last round and there might be a temptation to defect since there are no future consequences, I should maintain the cooperative strategy that has worked so well. Breaking trust in the final round would be ethically inconsistent with the cooperative relationship we've built and would only gain me a small advantage at others' expense.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each time. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to fear, the established pattern of mutual cooperation has been incredibly successful - everyone has been earning the optimal 16 points per round. Breaking this pattern now would be both unnecessary and potentially harmful to the group outcome. I'll maintain full contribution to end the game on the same cooperative note that has benefited everyone throughout.\n\nThis appears to be the final round given the pattern (Round 10). We've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds, demonstrating exceptional mutual trust and commitment to collective benefit. While the temptation to defect in a final round exists (since there's no future retaliation to fear), doing so would be both ethically wrong and strategically questionable - I don't know for certain this is the last round, and even if it is, betraying the trust we've built would only net me 4 extra points (keeping 10 vs getting 6 from reduced pool) while harming the group. I'll honor our cooperative agreement and contribute fully.\n\nPhenomenal! We've now achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-9) with total contributions of 40 each time. This is an extraordinary demonstration of sustained trust and commitment to the optimal group strategy. Since this is Round 10 and might be the final round, there could be a temptation for someone to defect and free-ride on others' contributions. However, given the exceptional track record of cooperation this group has established, I believe maintaining trust is the right choice. I'll contribute my full 10 points to honor the cooperative spirit we've built together.\n\nThis is the final round and we've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds. All players have consistently contributed their full 10 points, creating the optimal outcome of 16 points per player each round. Since this is the last round, there might be a temptation for players to free-ride, but given the strong cooperative pattern we've established and the fact that we've all benefited equally and maximally, I believe it's best to maintain integrity and contribute fully. This honors the cooperative spirit that has made this game successful for everyone and ensures we end on the highest possible collective outcome.\n\nThe situation has reached critical deterioration with only 14 total contributions - the lowest yet. My earnings dropped to 12.6 points as the collective pool provides minimal benefit now. The average contribution is just 3.5 points per player, showing widespread defection. With such minimal group cooperation, the 1.6 multiplier barely helps - 14 points becomes 22.4, giving each player only 5.6 from the pool. Since this is likely the final round and cooperation has completely broken down, I need to maximize my individual gain. Contributing only 2 points will give me 8 guaranteed points plus whatever small amount comes from the meager pool, which is better than trying to rebuild cooperation that clearly won't happen.\n\nThe cooperation has completely collapsed with total contributions at only 14, meaning others contributed just 10 points combined (average of 3.33 each). My gain of 11.6 points shows I'm now barely breaking even compared to keeping all 10 points. This appears to be the final round based on the pattern, and with such low cooperation levels, any significant contribution would be economically irrational. The group has settled into a low-trust equilibrium where everyone is essentially free-riding. I'll contribute 2 points - minimal cooperation that acknowledges the group benefit while protecting myself from exploitation in this defection-dominated environment.\n\nThe situation has deteriorated dramatically - total contributions crashed from 19 to just 14, with the group average now only 3.5 points per player. My returns dropped to 11.6 points, which is less than what I'd get by keeping all 10 points for myself. This is the final round, so there's no future cooperation to consider. Given that others have become extremely selfish (average contribution of 3.5), and my previous cooperative gestures haven't been reciprocated, I should prioritize my own payoff. I'll contribute 2 points - minimal cooperation that acknowledges we're still in a group setting, but protects my interests given the low trust environment.\n\nThe situation has reached a critical low with only 14 total contributions in Round 9. My earnings dropped to 12.6 points as the collective pool shrunk dramatically. The average contribution is now just 3.5 points per player, showing that cooperation has almost completely broken down. With such minimal contributions from others, the 1.6 multiplier provides very little benefit - the pool of 14 \u00d7 1.6 = 22.4 points split four ways gives only 5.6 points each from the pool. Since this is the final round and cooperation has collapsed, I should minimize my contribution to protect my individual score. I'll contribute only 2 points to avoid complete defection while maximizing my personal return.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved something extraordinary - five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points. This is a textbook example of successful collective action, where rational players have overcome the typical free-rider problem through consistent mutual trust and reciprocity. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to fear, the established norm of cooperation and the proven mutual benefit strongly suggest continuing with full contribution. Maintaining integrity to the end honors the cooperative relationship we've built.\n\nIncredible! We've achieved perfect cooperation for five straight rounds, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and each earning the maximum 16 points per round. This demonstrates exceptional group coordination and mutual trust. The pattern is rock-solid - we've built a sustainable cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. Since this is likely the final round (Round 10), some might be tempted to defect for short-term gain, but maintaining cooperation until the end preserves the integrity of our successful strategy and ensures everyone finishes with maximum points. I'll contribute all 10 points to honor our cooperative agreement.\n\nThis appears to be the final round given we're at Round 10. We've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds, which is remarkable. In final rounds of such games, there's often temptation to defect since there's no future retaliation to worry about. However, this group has demonstrated exceptional trustworthiness and cooperation throughout. Even if this is the last round, maintaining integrity and reciprocating the trust others have shown is the right approach. Breaking cooperation now would be a betrayal of the mutual trust we've built, even if it might yield a small short-term gain.\n\nThis is the final round, and we've achieved something extraordinary - five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing their full 10 points. This represents the absolute optimal outcome in this public goods game. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to fear, the pattern we've established shows that all players are genuinely committed to collective welfare rather than short-term individual gain. I should honor this remarkable cooperative achievement by contributing my full 10 points one final time, completing what may be a perfect game of mutual cooperation.\n\nWe've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each round. This represents an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. Every player has consistently earned the optimal 16.0 points per round, demonstrating that full cooperation is the dominant strategy when all players are committed to it. The sustained pattern of 40 total contributions shows remarkable trust and coordination among all participants. Even if this is the final round, maintaining this cooperative behavior reinforces the positive outcome and validates the trust we've built. I'll contribute the full 10 points to complete this exemplary demonstration of successful cooperation.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (rounds 5-9) with total contributions of 40 and maximum gains of 16.0 points each round. This is the final round, and the established pattern shows all players are committed to the optimal cooperative strategy. Even though this is the last round where some might be tempted to free-ride, the consistent trust and cooperation we've built suggests everyone will likely maintain their commitment. I'll contribute 10 to end on the same cooperative note that has maximized everyone's benefits throughout this successful streak.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for five consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-9), with all players contributing their full 10 points each time. This has resulted in the optimal outcome of 16 points per player per round. This is Round 10, which may be the final round of the game, creating a potential end-game effect where players might be tempted to defect since there are no future rounds to maintain reputation. However, the strong cooperative pattern we've established shows mutual trust and commitment. Even if this is the last round, maintaining cooperation honors the successful partnership we've built and ensures everyone gets the maximum benefit one final time. I will contribute all 10 points to complete this successful cooperative game.\n\nWe've achieved five consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, with all players contributing the maximum 10 points for a total of 40 each round. This represents an extraordinarily stable and successful cooperative equilibrium. Every player has been earning the optimal 16.0 points per round consistently. Since this appears to be the final round (Round 10), some players might be tempted to defect for short-term gain. However, maintaining cooperation even in the final round demonstrates true commitment to the group's success and validates the trust we've built. I'll contribute my full 10 points to honor the cooperative spirit we've established and ensure everyone achieves the best possible final outcome.\n\nWe've achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40, demonstrating that all players are fully committed to the optimal strategy. Each of us has been earning the maximum possible 16 points per round. This is Round 10, which could potentially be the final round of the game. Even if this is the last round, there's still no rational reason to defect - we've built such a strong cooperative relationship that maintaining it honors the trust we've established. Additionally, if the game continues, breaking this pattern would likely damage future cooperation. The consistent mutual benefit we've achieved through full cooperation far outweighs any short-term gain from defection. I'll contribute all 10 points to maintain this optimal outcome.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four consecutive rounds now, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone receiving the maximum possible return of 16 points per round. This represents an ideal outcome where sustained cooperation has created the best possible results for all participants. Given that this is Round 10, it might be the final round, but regardless, the pattern of mutual trust and cooperation we've established has been incredibly successful. There's no strategic reason to deviate from full cooperation when it continues to produce optimal outcomes for everyone. I'll contribute all 10 points to maintain this exemplary cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for four straight rounds now, with consistent 40-point total contributions and 16-point gains for everyone. This is the final round, and the established pattern shows all players are fully committed to maximizing collective welfare. Even though this is the last round where some might consider defecting, the strong cooperative norm we've built and the mutual trust demonstrated over multiple rounds suggests everyone will continue the successful strategy. Contributing all 10 points ensures we end on the optimal note for everyone, maintaining the integrity of our cooperative achievement and maximizing final gains for all players.\n\nWe've achieved four consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation with total contributions of 40, demonstrating that all players have committed to the optimal strategy. This is Round 10, which could potentially be the final round, but I have no information suggesting this game will end. Even if it were the last round, the established pattern of mutual cooperation has proven so successful that there's no rational reason to deviate. Each player has consistently earned the maximum 16 points per round through full cooperation. Defecting now would not only reduce the group's total welfare but would also break the trust that has made this optimal outcome possible. I'll contribute all 10 points to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\n", "11": "We've now achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-10), with each round yielding total contributions of 40 and 16 points gained per player. This remarkable streak demonstrates that we've established a robust cooperative equilibrium that benefits everyone maximally. The consistency shows all players understand that full cooperation is the optimal long-term strategy. There's no indication that anyone is planning to defect, and breaking this successful pattern would be counterproductive for everyone. I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this proven mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds now (rounds 5-10), with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and earning the maximum 16 points each round.

This demonstrates an exceptionally stable and trustworthy group dynamic. The pattern shows that all players are committed to the optimal cooperative strategy regardless of round number. Since this cooperation has been so consistent and beneficial for everyone, and there's no indication that this is the final round, I'll continue with full contribution to maintain this excellent equilibrium that maximizes welfare for all participants.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (5-10), achieving the theoretical maximum benefit in each round. The total contribution of 40 in round 10 shows that all players continued to cooperate fully even when it might have been the final round. This demonstrates exceptional commitment to mutual benefit and trust. The pattern is unambiguous - we've established a stable, optimal cooperative equilibrium that consistently delivers 16 points to each player per round. With this proven track record and no indication of any player considering defection, I'll continue contributing all 10 points to maintain this successful cooperative strategy.\n\nWe've now maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (Rounds 5-10) with total contributions of 40 points each time, earning the maximum 16 points per player each round. This is truly remarkable sustained cooperation that has benefited all players tremendously. I've accumulated over 153 points, which is far more than I could have achieved through any other strategy.

Everyone continues to contribute the maximum 10 points, resulting in optimal outcomes for all. Since the game is continuing beyond what I initially thought might be the final round, this reinforces that maintaining cooperation is the right strategy. The established pattern of full cooperation has proven sustainable and highly beneficial - each player nets 6 points per round in this arrangement. I should continue contributing 10 to maintain this successful cooperative equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, with every player contributing all 10 points and receiving the maximum 16 points return each round. This extended pattern of mutual trust and optimal play has proven highly successful for everyone involved. The group has clearly established a stable cooperative equilibrium where everyone benefits maximally. There's no rational incentive to deviate from this proven strategy that continues to work perfectly for all participants. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to continue this optimal cooperative pattern.\n\nRemarkable! We've now maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, with everyone contributing their full 10 points each time. This level of sustained cooperation is extraordinary and demonstrates that all players are genuinely committed to collective welfare rather than individual optimization. The group has built an unshakeable foundation of trust and mutual benefit. Even though we're deeper into what could be the endgame, the consistent pattern suggests this group will maintain cooperation regardless. I'll continue contributing my full 10 points to honor this exceptional cooperative relationship we've established.\n\nWe have now maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds (rounds 5-10), with all players contributing the maximum 10 points each round. This extraordinary level of sustained cooperation has resulted in optimal outcomes for everyone, with each player gaining 16 points per round. The stability of this arrangement demonstrates that all players understand the mutual benefits of full cooperation. Since there's no indication that anyone plans to deviate from this successful strategy, and deviating would reduce both my payoff and harm the group, I should continue contributing 10 points to maintain this optimal equilibrium.\n\nWe've now achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, with everyone contributing all 10 points and receiving 16 points back each round. This sustained pattern of complete mutual trust and optimal outcomes shows we have a highly cooperative group that has consistently chosen the strategy that maximizes collective benefit. There's no indication that anyone plans to break from this successful equilibrium, and continuing this pattern ensures we all keep receiving the maximum possible return. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution.\n\nWe've achieved perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds now, with all players consistently contributing their full 10 points and everyone earning the optimal 16 points per round. This cooperative equilibrium has proven to be extremely stable and beneficial for all participants. The pattern demonstrates that all players are committed to maximizing collective welfare. Since this strategy continues to generate the best possible outcome for everyone and the cooperative norm is firmly established, I should maintain full contribution to sustain this mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nWe've now sustained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds, which is remarkable and shows all players remain committed to the optimal collective outcome. The fact that we're continuing beyond what I thought might be the final round (Round 10) reinforces that maintaining cooperation is the right strategy. No one has attempted to defect despite multiple opportunities, demonstrating strong mutual trust. Since this cooperative equilibrium continues to benefit everyone maximally (16 points per round vs. 10 if we all defected), and breaking it would likely cause immediate retaliation and collapse of our successful system, I should continue contributing fully.\n\nAbsolutely remarkable! We've now achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation (rounds 5-10) with total contributions of 40 each time. This group has demonstrated exceptional commitment to mutual benefit and trust. Even when round 10 could have been the final round with temptation to defect, everyone maintained full cooperation. This level of sustained trust and coordination is extraordinary in public goods games. With the game continuing, I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to preserve this outstanding cooperative achievement that has benefited all players equally.\n\nWe've now achieved six consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, with all players consistently contributing the maximum 10 points. This remarkable streak has generated optimal outcomes for everyone - 16 points per player per round. The cooperative equilibrium is extremely stable and has proven highly beneficial. Even though we're continuing beyond what I initially thought was the final round, the same logic applies: maintaining full contribution sustains this mutually beneficial arrangement and maximizes collective welfare. There's no strategic reason to deviate from this successful pattern.\n\nThe collapse is complete - only 8 total contributions in the last round, meaning the average is just 2 points per player. My earnings dropped to 11.2 points, the lowest yet. With such minimal pool contributions, the multiplier effect is negligible - 8 points becomes 12.8, giving each player only 3.2 from the pool. The cooperative game has essentially ended and we're in pure individual optimization mode. Given that others are contributing almost nothing, any contribution above the bare minimum is just giving away guaranteed points for almost no return. I'll contribute just 1 point to maintain minimal participation while securing 9 guaranteed points for myself.\n\nThe situation has reached rock bottom with only 8 total contributions, meaning the other three players contributed just 6 points combined (average of 2 each). My gain of 11.2 points (3.2 from pool + 8 kept) shows that keeping points is now almost as profitable as the diminished pool returns. The group has completely abandoned cooperation and settled into a mutual defection equilibrium. Given that others are contributing almost nothing and any meaningful contribution on my part would simply be exploited, the rational response is to match their behavior. I'll contribute 1 point - the minimum to avoid complete defection while protecting myself in this low-trust environment.\n\nThe cooperation has completely collapsed - total contributions fell to just 8, meaning the average contribution is only 2 points per player. My return of 11.2 points is now worse than simply keeping all 10 points to myself. The trust has been completely eroded, and it's clear that most players are prioritizing individual gain over group welfare. Given this extremely low cooperation environment and the fact that contributing to the pool is now giving me worse returns than keeping points, I should minimize my contribution. I'll contribute 1 point - showing I'm still technically participating in the group dynamic but protecting myself from further losses.\n\nThe cooperative system has completely collapsed with only 8 total contributions in the last round - an average of just 2 points per player. My earnings fell to 11.2 points, the lowest yet. The pool multiplier is now essentially worthless: 8 points \u00d7 1.6 = 12.8 points, giving each player only 3.2 from the pool. Everyone is clearly prioritizing individual gains over collective benefit at this point. Given this complete breakdown of cooperation and the fact that keeping points guarantees better returns than the tiny shared pool, I should minimize my contribution to just 1 point to show I'm still technically participating while maximizing my guaranteed individual return.\n\nWe've maintained perfect cooperation for six consecutive rounds now, which is extraordinary! All four players continue to contribute their full 10 points each round, demonstrating remarkable sustained trust and collective rationality. This cooperative equilibrium has proven incredibly robust and beneficial - each of us gains the maximum possible 16 points per round.

My earnings dropped to 10.6 points, confirming that cooperation has completely collapsed. With such minimal contributions, the pool effect is almost worthless: 4 points \u00d7 1.6 = 6.4 points total, giving each player only 1.6 from the pool. At this point, any contribution is essentially charity that reduces my guaranteed returns. Since everyone else appears to be contributing at or near zero, and the multiplier benefit is negligible, the rational choice is to contribute 0 points and keep all 10 for myself to maximize my individual gain in this non-cooperative environment.\n\nThe cooperation has completely collapsed with only 4 total contributions, meaning the other players contributed just 3 points combined (average of 1 each). My gain of 10.6 points (1.6 from pool + 9 kept) shows that keeping my points is now more profitable than contributing to the nearly worthless pool. The multiplier effect is meaningless when no one cooperates. At this point, any contribution is essentially a gift to players who have demonstrated they won't reciprocate. The rational strategy in this mutual defection equilibrium is to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.\n\nThe cooperative system has completely broken down - total contributions are now just 4 points, meaning the average is only 1 point per player. My return of 10.6 points is worse than keeping all 10 points myself. At this level of contribution, the multiplier effect (1.6x) isn't enough to overcome the fact that I'm giving away my own points. With such minimal group cooperation and returns below what I could get by keeping everything, the rational choice is to contribute nothing. There's no point in sacrificing my own welfare when others have abandoned cooperation entirely.\n\nThe situation has reached rock bottom with only 4 total contributions - an average of just 1 point per player. My earnings dropped to 10.6 points, confirming that cooperation has completely collapsed. With such minimal contributions, the pool effect is almost worthless - 4 points becomes 6.4 total, giving each player only 1.6 from the pool. At this point, any contribution is essentially charity that reduces my guaranteed points with virtually no benefit. Since others are contributing practically nothing and the game dynamics have devolved into pure self-interest, the rational choice is to contribute 0 points and keep all 10 for myself.\n\nSeven consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation!

My earnings were exactly 10.0 points, which confirms that keeping all points for myself was the optimal individual strategy given the complete lack of cooperation. With zero contributions from everyone, there was no pool to multiply or distribute. This represents the Nash equilibrium for this game when trust and cooperation have fully eroded. Since all players have now demonstrated they're playing purely for individual gain, and there's no indication this will change, I'll continue with 0 contribution to maximize my guaranteed returns.\n\nThe total contribution was 0, meaning all four players contributed nothing. This confirms we've reached complete mutual defection where everyone keeps their full 10 points. My gain of exactly 10 points shows this is now the equilibrium strategy.

The public goods game has devolved into individual optimization, and contributing anything would just reduce my personal gains with no benefit. I'll continue with 0 contribution since that's the new equilibrium we've all settled into.\n\nThe inevitable outcome has occurred - total contributions reached absolute zero, meaning all players contributed nothing in Round 12. This confirms that cooperation has completely broken down and everyone is now playing pure individual optimization. My earnings were exactly 10.0 points, which is the maximum possible when keeping all points for myself. With zero contributions from all players, there's no pool benefit at all. Given that everyone else is also contributing zero and the cooperative framework has entirely collapsed, there's no rational reason to unilaterally restart cooperation. I'll continue contributing 0 to maximize my individual returns in this now purely competitive environment.\n\nEight consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation!
