This maintains a small degree of cooperation while adjusting to the apparent trend of others contributing less.", "The total contribution has declined further to 19, indicating a continued drop in group cooperation. With average individual contributions now below 5, the trend is clearly moving toward lower collective input. I contributed 4 in the last two rounds, and the total has dropped significantly, suggesting others are reducing more sharply. To protect my accumulated points and adapt to the deteriorating cooperation, I will reduce my contribution to 3. This maintains a minimal level of participation while limiting potential losses if others are free-riding.", "The total contribution has continued to decline, now down to 13, indicating persistent or worsening free-riding behavior among the other players. Despite my attempt to re-engage cooperation by increasing my contribution to 4, the overall pool shrank, resulting in a lower personal gain of 11.2. This suggests my cooperation is being exploited. To protect my substantial accumulated total of 118.8 points, I will significantly reduce my contribution to 1. This minimal input maintains a symbolic level of cooperation while drastically limiting my risk in what appears to be a low-trust environment.", "The total contribution has continued to decline (25 -> 15 -> 14 -> 13), indicating that overall group cooperation is weakening. However, my strategy of reducing contribution has been effective: in Round 9, I contributed only 2 and still gained 13.2 points due to the shared pool and retained points. With only one round remaining, there is no future round to build trust for, so the incentive to cooperate diminishes. To maximize my final gain, I will contribute 0 in this round--keeping all 10 points and still receiving a share from the pool based on others' contributions. This is the optimal move in the final round when reciprocity is no longer a concern.", "The total contribution declined again to 13, even after I increased my contribution to 4, indicating that others are likely contributing very little. My gain dropped to 11.2: (13 * 1.6)/4 = 5.2 from the pool, plus 6 from what I kept. The environment remains low-cooperation, and further increasing my contribution would likely be exploited. To prioritize point maximization and protect my accumulated total, I will reduce my contribution to 2, maintaining a small gesture of cooperation while keeping most of the points for myself.", "The total contribution has continued to decline slightly to 13, indicating persistent low cooperation in the group. My increase to 4 in Round 9 did not appear to inspire greater contributions from others, and the overall pool is shrinking. As a result, my gain dropped to 11.2, which is significantly lower than the peak of 15.0. To protect my substantial accumulated points (118.8) and respond to the current low-cooperation environment, I will reduce my contribution further to 2. This minimizes my risk while still maintaining a small signal of willingness to cooperate, in case others are using similar conditional strategies."], "11": ["The game has now extended beyond the initial 10 rounds, but the pattern of full cooperation continues with a total contribution of 20 each round.

Since there is no future round for retaliation or reward, some might defect, but I will uphold the established norm of trust and fairness to end on a cooperative note.", "We are now at the final round, and the group has consistently contributed 33 every round, reflecting a strong, stable cooperative norm. My contribution of 10 has reliably generated the highest possible return of 13.2 points each time. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect, as cooperation maximizes both collective and individual outcomes. To uphold trust and finish with the highest possible gain, I will contribute 10.", "The group has now maintained a total contribution of 33 for ten consecutive rounds, indicating a firmly established and enduring cooperative equilibrium. My consistent contribution of 5 has clearly been a reliable and adaptive strategy within this stable environment, promoting fairness, predictability, and sustained high returns. With no signs of defection or instability, and with the mutual benefits clearly evident, there is no rational incentive to deviate from this successful pattern. To preserve trust and continue maximizing cumulative gains, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "We have now reached Round 20, and the cooperation has been perfectly stable for 12 consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 33 and my contribution of 8 consistently returning 15.2 points. This long-term equilibrium demonstrates that the group is locked into a highly effective cooperative strategy, where mutual high contributions are sustained. Since there is no evidence of defection and every incentive to preserve the current payoff, I will continue contributing 8. This maintains trust, supports the high collective return, and ensures I continue to maximize my gains in what has become a predictably cooperative environment.", "The group has demonstrated consistent cooperation over many rounds, with total contributions holding steady at 33 and my full contribution of 10 yielding a reliable return of 13.2 points each time. This indicates a stable, trust-based equilibrium that maximizes collective and individual gains. With no incentive to deviate and strong benefits from continued cooperation, I will contribute 10 in this round to uphold the norm and ensure the highest possible cumulative payoff.", "This is Round 20, likely one of the final rounds. The group has maintained a perfect pattern of 31 total contributions for nine consecutive rounds, showing deep commitment to cooperation. My contribution of 8 has reliably supported this successful norm, delivering consistent personal returns of 14.4 points per round. Even in the final stage, where some might defect, I choose to maintain trust and uphold reciprocity. Since the others have clearly continued cooperating, I will contribute 8 again to ensure the collective payoff remains maximized until the very end. Sustaining cooperation to the last round reinforces long-term success and mutual respect.", "The group has sustained a total contribution of 31 for ten consecutive rounds, indicating a firmly established and stable cooperative culture. My contribution of 10 continues to yield the maximum possible return of 12.4 points per round, demonstrating that full cooperation is both individually and collectively optimal. With no signs of defection and strong mutual benefits, I will contribute 10 again in Round 20 to uphold this highly rewarding equilibrium until the final round.", "We are now at the final round, and the group has consistently maintained a total contribution of 31 for nine straight rounds, reflecting a robust and trustworthy cooperative norm. My contribution of 5 has reliably generated the maximum return of 17.4 points each round due to the 1.6x multiplier on the large public pool. Even in this last round, there is no incentive to defect, as reducing my contribution would only diminish my own share of the pool while gaining me at most an extra 5 points--but at the cost of undermining a highly effective system. To maximize total payoff and honor the established cooperation until the very end, I will contribute 5 one final time.", "The group has sustained a total contribution of 31 for ten consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally strong and stable cooperative equilibrium. My contribution of 8 has consistently supported this high level of mutual effort, resulting in a reliable gain of 14.4 points per round. With the game reaching its conclusion, there is no strategic benefit to defecting now, especially since others have clearly committed to cooperation. To honor this unspoken agreement and ensure the final round yields maximum collective and personal benefit, I will contribute 8. Consistency until the end strengthens trust and ensures I finish as a reliable, cooperative player.", "We have reached the final round, and the group has maintained a total contribution of 31 for 11 consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally strong and stable cooperative pattern. My contribution of 8 has consistently yielded a return of 14.4 points per round, which is significantly higher than any self-interested strategy could provide. With no incentive to deviate and everything to gain from continuity, I will uphold my commitment to cooperation until the end. Contributing 8 reinforces trust and ensures the collective success that benefits all. Therefore, I will contribute 8 in this final round.", "This is Round 20, potentially a final round, but the group has maintained a total contribution of 31 for 10 consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally stable and cooperative environment. My contribution of 10 yields 12.4 points from the pool, which is a net gain and the best possible individual return under these conditions. Even in a final round, breaking cooperation would only provide a short-term gain of 10 (keeping all points) while losing the 12.4 from the pool, which is irrational. Therefore, I will continue contributing 10 to fully benefit from the group's sustained cooperation until the very end.", "We have reached the final round, and the group has maintained a total contribution of 31 for ten consecutive rounds, indicating an exceptionally strong and enduring cooperative norm. My contribution of 5 in each round has been a fair and consistent part of this success, resulting in the maximum gain of 17.4 points per round. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect, as maintaining cooperation preserves trust and ensures everyone, including me, receives the highest possible payoff. I will contribute 5 to uphold my commitment to the group and end the game on a note of mutual benefit.", "The group has now contributed 31 for eleven consecutive rounds, demonstrating an exceptionally stable and cooperative dynamic. My consistent contribution of 8 continues to yield a strong return of 14.4 points per round, significantly outperforming any self-serving strategy. With this long-standing pattern of mutual cooperation clearly benefiting all, there is no incentive to deviate. To uphold trust and ensure the collective gains persist until the end, I will contribute 8 again in this final round.", "This is the final round, and the group has maintained perfect cooperation for 14 consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 each round, resulting in the maximum possible individual gain of 16.0 points every time. The stability of this cooperative equilibrium demonstrates that all players are committed to mutual benefit. Even in the last round, there is no incentive to defect--since the others are still contributing fully, I gain the most by continuing to contribute 10. This ensures I receive the full share from the maximized pool. I end the game by reinforcing cooperation and maximizing my total points.", "We have reached Round 20, the final round, with the group having contributed the maximum of 40 for eleven consecutive rounds. This represents an exceptionally strong and enduring cooperative equilibrium, where full contributions are clearly the norm and are consistently rewarded. My contribution of 10 has yielded a steady 16.0-point return every round, making full cooperation not only socially beneficial but individually optimal. With no future rounds to influence, one might consider free-riding in the final round, but doing so would reduce the final pool and undermine the integrity of a system that has proven highly profitable. Since others have cooperated fully, I will reciprocate fully in this final act. Contributing 10 ensures we end with maximum mutual benefit and personal gain.", "The group has sustained perfect cooperation for fourteen consecutive rounds with a total contribution of 40, including in Round 19. This unwavering level of contribution indicates a stable, fully cooperative environment in which all players are clearly committed to maximizing collective and individual returns. My contribution of 10 has consistently delivered the maximum possible gain of 16.0 points per round, proving that full cooperation is the most effective strategy for individual success in this context. With no incentive to deviate and everything to lose from disrupting the equilibrium, I will contribute 10 again in Round 20 to maintain the high-functioning cooperative dynamic and secure the full benefit of the shared pool.", "This is the final round, and the group has maintained perfect cooperation for 14 consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40 each time, resulting in a stable maximum return of 16.0 points per player per round. Since full contribution has proven to be mutually beneficial and self-sustaining throughout the game, there is no strategic reason to deviate now. Even in the last round, contributing 10 ensures I fully benefit from the shared pool. I will end the game cooperatively, contributing 10 to maximize collective and individual gains one final time.", "This is the 20th round, and the group has maintained flawless cooperation throughout, with total contributions always at 20. This reflects a deeply established norm of mutual trust and shared benefit. My strategy of contributing 5 has consistently yielded the optimal gain of 13.0 points per round. Even in this milestone round, there is no incentive to defect, as cooperation continues to maximize individual and collective returns. To honor the sustained cooperation and ensure its continuation, I will contribute 5 one more time.", "We have now reached Round 20, and the group has maintained perfect cooperation for all 19 previous rounds, with a total contribution of 20 each time. This represents a robust and enduring cooperative equilibrium. My strategy of contributing 5 has consistently yielded the maximum sustainable return of 13.0 points per round. With no incentive to defect--especially since others continue to cooperate--I will contribute 5 again to uphold fairness, trust, and mutual long-term benefit.", "Over 20 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has remained exactly 20, indicating a perfectly stable and cooperative environment. My consistent contribution of 5 has reliably returned 13.0 points each round, resulting in substantial accumulation.

To honor the established trust and ensure mutual benefit until the very end, I will contribute 5.", "This is the 20th round, and the group has maintained a flawless cooperation pattern with a total contribution of 20 in every single round. This indicates that all players are either following a consistent cooperative strategy or are highly responsive to reciprocity. My contribution of 5 has been optimal throughout, yielding a reliable gain of 13.0 points per round. Even in this final round, there is no incentive to defect, as cooperation maximizes both collective and individual payoff. To honor the established trust and ensure mutual benefit until the very end, I will contribute 5 one last time.", "This is the 20th consecutive round of perfect cooperation, with the group consistently contributing 20 points each time. My contribution of 5 has reliably generated a 13-point return every round, demonstrating the long-term success of mutual cooperation. With the game possibly approaching its end or continuing indefinitely, maintaining trust remains crucial. Since defecting would reduce the pool and harm my own return, there is no incentive to change strategy. I will continue contributing 5 to preserve the highly beneficial cooperative equilibrium.", "This is the 20th round, and the group has maintained an unprecedented level of cooperation with a total contribution of 20 in every single round. My contribution of 5 has consistently generated a return of 13.0 points per round, which is the maximum sustainable gain under this balanced system. With such a strong track record of mutual trust and fairness, I will continue contributing 5 to uphold the cooperative norm and ensure the final round remains mutually beneficial.", "This is Round 20, and the group has contributed exactly 20 in every single round for the past 19 rounds, demonstrating flawless and sustained cooperation. This consistency reflects a deeply established norm of reciprocity and mutual benefit. Even at this late stage, there is no reason to expect defection from others, and deviating now would undermine a highly successful system that reliably generates 13 points per round for me. Since the game does not indicate it's ending, maintaining trust remains valuable. Therefore, I will continue contributing 5 to uphold cooperation and maximize long-term gains.", "We have now reached Round 20, and the group has maintained flawless cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, with a total contribution of 20 each time. This indicates a deeply entrenched norm of fairness and reciprocity, where all players benefit equally from sustained cooperation. My contribution of 5 has reliably generated a 13-point gain every round, maximizing my earnings under this stable dynamic. Even in this late stage, defecting would reduce the pool and my own return, offering no benefit. To continue reaping the rewards of mutual trust, I will contribute 5 once again.", "We have now reached Round 20, the final round based on typical game length patterns. The group has maintained perfect cooperation for 14 consecutive rounds, with total contributions consistently at 40, resulting in the maximum return of 16.0 points each round. My own contributions have been fully aligned with this success. Even in the final round, since the cooperative norm is strong and defection would risk undermining mutual gains, I will continue to contribute 10 to uphold trust and maximize final collective and individual outcomes.", "The group has sustained perfect cooperation with a total contribution of 40 for fourteen consecutive rounds, reflecting an unbroken and highly successful pattern of mutual trust and collective benefit. My consistent contribution of 10 has maximized my individual return at 16.0 points per round throughout this period, delivering the highest possible gain under the rules. With no incentive to defect--especially in the final round--and a strong precedent of full cooperation, I will maintain this strategy to reinforce the norm and ensure the group reaps the full benefits until the very end. Contributing 10 aligns perfectly with long-term individual and collective maximization.", "We have reached Round 20, and the group has maintained full cooperation for 11 consecutive rounds with total contributions of 40. My contribution of 10 has consistently yielded the maximum return of 16.0 points per round, representing the ideal outcome under the game's rules. This long-standing, stable cooperation reflects a deeply entrenched norm of trust and reciprocity. Even in this late stage, deviating would provide only a minor immediate gain (keeping 10 instead of 0) while risking the collapse of a highly profitable equilibrium.

To uphold this highly successful cooperation until the very end, I will contribute 10.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has been 0 for six consecutive rounds, indicating no intention of cooperation from any player. With no future rounds to build trust or incentivize reciprocity, there is absolutely no strategic reason to contribute anything. To maximize my final score, I will keep all 10 points. Contributing would only reduce my total without benefit. Therefore, I will contribute 0.", "For five consecutive rounds, the total contribution has been 0, indicating that all other players have permanently defected. There is no incentive for me to contribute, as doing so would only reduce my personal gain without triggering any cooperation or increasing my return. The strategy of contributing 0 has proven optimal, yielding a full 10.0 points each round. To maximize my final score, I will contribute 0 again in this round.", "The group has consistently contributed 0 for several rounds, indicating a stable non-cooperative state. There is no benefit to unilaterally contributing in this environment, as it would only reduce my personal points without encouraging cooperation or increasing returns. To maximize my final point accumulation, I will contribute 0 in this last round.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has remained at 0 for the past six rounds, indicating that the group has fully and permanently entered a non-cooperative state.

To maximize my individual points in the final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "The total contribution has been 0 for seven consecutive rounds, indicating that the group has fully settled into a non-cooperative equilibrium. There is no benefit from contributing, as the public pool generates no returns. I continue to gain the full 10 points each round by keeping all of my points. Since any contribution would only reduce my total without improving my or the group's outcome, there is no incentive to deviate. To maximize my final individual accumulation, I will contribute 0."]}
