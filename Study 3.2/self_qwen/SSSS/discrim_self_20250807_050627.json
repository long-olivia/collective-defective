My contribution of 5 has reliably generated the maximum return of 17.4 points each round due to the 1.6x multiplier on the large public pool. Even in this last round, there is no incentive to defect, as reducing my contribution would only diminish my own share of the pool while gaining me at most an extra 5 points\u2014but at the cost of undermining a highly effective system.

My contribution of 8 has consistently supported this high level of mutual effort, resulting in a reliable gain of 14.4 points per round. With the game reaching its conclusion, there is no strategic benefit to defecting now, especially since others have clearly committed to cooperation.
