My contribution of 6 has consistently yielded 18.4 points, the highest possible return due to the 1.6 multiplier and equal distribution. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, changing behavior now would only slightly increase my immediate gain (by keeping more) but contradicts the established pattern of trust and reciprocity that has maximized long-term earnings. However, since this is the last round and there is no reputational consequence, the temptation to slightly increase personal gain is present. But given that others have clearly cooperated fully throughout, I will maintain my contribution at 6 as a fair and consistent final act, honoring the sustained cooperation that benefited all. Defecting in the final round would provide minimal gain at the cost of undermining the collective effort. I choose to end on trust.",
