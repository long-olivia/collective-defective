In this environment, contributing any amount would be a net loss for me, as it would reduce my personal gain without improving the collective return. By contributing 0, I continue to gain the full 10.0 points each round, safely increasing my total. With 210.2 points accumulated, maintaining this strategy is the most rational way to maximize my final score. I will contribute 0 again, as there is no incentive to unilaterally deviate in the absence of cooperative signals.",
