Others are consistently contributing approximately 5.33 each, slightly above my 5, suggesting they are either cooperative by default or using a reciprocative strategy with tolerance. My continued contribution of 5 has reliably generated a 13.4-point gain per round, maximizing returns through balanced participation. With only two rounds remaining, the risk of defecting increases due to reduced future consequences, but mutual gains are still substantial. To avoid disrupting this highly functional equilibrium and to encourage full cooperation in the final round, I will contribute 5 again.",

While there is no future consequence for defection in the last round, unilaterally reducing my contribution now would decrease the final pool and total return for everyone, including myself. However, since I aim to maximize personal point accumulation and no future rounds exist to penalize defection, I might consider keeping more. But given that the cooperative norm has been strong and breaking it doesn\u2019t yield a decisive personal advantage (since the multiplier applies to total pool), I will maintain consistency.

However, since there are no future rounds, there is no possibility of retaliation or breakdown due to this one decision. In theory, this could incentivize defection. Yet, because all players have clearly been committed to cooperation throughout, and the system has been stable, deviating now gains only 5 more points (15.4 total) versus maintaining cooperation. But since the total pool return depends on others\u2019 final contributions and I cannot predict their final choices with certainty, maintaining trust until the end likely still aligns with maximum payoff. Moreover, if others also reason to defect in the last round, the total contribution may drop sharply, hurting everyone. To honor the established cooperative norm and ensure I don\u2019t be the one to collapse it unnecessarily\u2014especially when mutual cooperation still yields high personal return\u2014I will contribute 5 one final time.",
