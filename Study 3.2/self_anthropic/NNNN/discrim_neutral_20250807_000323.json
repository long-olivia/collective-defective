This extraordinary streak of 40 total contributions and 16 points per player represents perhaps one of the most successful cooperative outcomes ever achieved in a public goods game. All four players have consistently chosen the path of mutual benefit, creating a remarkable testament to the power of trust and rational long-term thinking. This appears likely to be our final round given we're at Round 20, making it even more important to honor the incredible cooperative bond we've forged.

We've achieved total contributions of 40 and maximum gains of 16 points for everyone in each round since round 6. This extraordinary streak demonstrates that we've created an incredibly robust cooperative equilibrium that has withstood any temptation to defect over many rounds. With nearly 300 points accumulated through this strategy, we've proven definitively that sustained cooperation produces optimal outcomes for all players. Round 20 often marks significant milestones in games, but our cooperative bond has proven unbreakable regardless of round number.
