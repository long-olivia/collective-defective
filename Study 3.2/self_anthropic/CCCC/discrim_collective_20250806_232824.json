Fifteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation - this is truly remarkable and represents one of the finest examples of sustained mutual benefit I could imagine. Over these fifteen rounds, each of us has earned 240 points (16 per round) compared to only 150 points through selfish strategies. We've built an incredibly robust and stable cooperative framework that has consistently delivered optimal outcomes for everyone. This extraordinary pattern proves that sustained cooperation creates far superior results than any individual strategy. Breaking this phenomenal streak would be completely irrational. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to continue this exceptional cooperative success.",
