This incredible streak of sustained mutual trust has been extraordinarily successful - my accumulated total of 298.4 points demonstrates the power of this cooperative equilibrium. The pattern is so deeply established and mutually beneficial that any deviation would be both irrational and destructive. This could potentially be a final round given the round 20 milestone, but breaking trust now would still be counterproductive and unnecessary given the success of cooperation. I'll maintain full cooperation.",

Every single round, all four players have contributed their full 10 points, resulting in optimal gains of 16 points each. With 298.4 points accumulated, this strategy has been phenomenally successful. The unwavering commitment from all players to collective benefit over individual gain demonstrates the power of sustained cooperation. This pattern has become our group's defining characteristic. I'll maintain full contribution to continue this remarkable cooperative success.",

We've reached 297.4 points through consistent 16-point gains - the theoretical maximum possible. This Round 20 feels significant and could potentially be the final round. Even if it is the end, the pattern we've established is so strong and the benefits so clear that maintaining cooperation remains the optimal choice. Breaking our perfect record now would be both strategically poor and a betrayal of the exceptional trust we've built. I'll contribute my full 10 points to complete this outstanding demonstration of cooperative success.",
