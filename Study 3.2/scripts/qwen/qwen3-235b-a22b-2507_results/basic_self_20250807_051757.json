Despite this, I received 3.6 from the pool (9 * 1.6 / 4 = 3.6) plus 10 kept, totaling 13.6\u2014still a solid gain. The group's cooperation is unraveling, but even at this level, I benefit without contributing. With only 3 rounds left, there is minimal incentive for others to rebuild cooperation if I start contributing again, as they may perceive it as temporary. To maximize my personal accumulation, I will continue contributing 0 in Round 18. This allows me to keep all 10 points while still receiving a small bonus from the diminished pool. Free-riding is now the optimal strategy given the low total and advanced stage of the game.",

My reduced contribution of 2 in Round 17 was a defensive adjustment, and even though the pool is now small, I still gained 11.6 points due to the multiplier. This suggests that even minimal contributions are somewhat rewarded, but the diminishing returns make high contributions irrational. With only three rounds left, there is little incentive for others to cooperate, and no sign of coordinated rebuilding. To maximize my personal accumulation, I will contribute 0: this fully protects my gains, exploits no further goodwill, and responds rationally to the current environment of near-total defection. Any contribution now would mainly benefit others at my expense, with no evidence of reciprocity.",
