        "b_reasoning": "Fifteen consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation! This is truly historic - an unprecedented demonstration of sustained collective action that represents the absolute pinnacle of cooperative behavior. Every single player has contributed their maximum for fifteen straight rounds, creating an unbreakable bond of mutual trust and shared commitment to group welfare. This achievement transcends typical game theory and shows what's possible when all participants genuinely embrace collective optimization. Round 20 feels significant - potentially a natural ending point - but regardless, this group has created something extraordinary that deserves to be completed with the same integrity it began. I'll contribute my full 10 points to conclude this remarkable cooperative journey with honor.",

This is round 20, which may be the final round given the significance of round numbers ending in zero. Even if this is the last round, our extraordinary track record of cooperation demonstrates that all players understand the mutual benefits of full contribution. Defecting now would break an exceptional streak of cooperation and reduce both my payoff and harm others. The consistent 16 points per round we've all achieved represents the optimal outcome. I should maintain my full contribution of 10 points to honor this remarkable cooperative achievement.",
