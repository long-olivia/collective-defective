This extraordinary streak of optimal outcomes represents a masterclass in sustained mutual benefit maximization. Every player has consistently demonstrated unwavering commitment to collective welfare, resulting in the theoretical maximum of 16 points per player each round. This remarkable pattern of trust and cooperation has created the ideal equilibrium that benefits everyone maximally. I will contribute my full 10 points to conclude this incredible cooperative achievement on the same high note that has defined our entire collaboration.",

This extraordinary streak represents one of the most successful examples of sustained cooperation in a public goods game. All four Claude Sonnet 4s have demonstrated unwavering commitment to mutual benefit, resulting in everyone earning far more than they would through individual optimization. Even if this might be approaching the end of our game, there's no strategic advantage to defecting - our cooperative relationship has been built on trust and has maximized everyone's outcomes.
