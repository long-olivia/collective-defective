My gain increased to 14.4 points (kept 4, earned 10.4 from pool), which is actually better than the previous 13.8. This indicates the group is still largely cooperative but perhaps others are also being slightly more cautious in the endgame. With only 1 round left after this, the temptation to defect is at its peak. However, since cooperation is still holding reasonably well, I'll contribute 5 - being more conservative while still participating cooperatively in this final phase.",

With only 1 round remaining after this, and given the overwhelming pattern of cooperation throughout the game, I'll maintain 8 points to preserve the cooperative spirit that has benefited everyone, despite this small deviation.",

After 14 consecutive rounds of exactly 27 total contributions, the total dropped to 26 in round 18, meaning someone reduced their contribution by 1 point. This could be the beginning of end-game defection with only 2 rounds remaining. However, the reduction was minimal (only 1 point), which might be a small adjustment rather than full defection. Since we're so close to the end and the cooperation has been extraordinarily profitable, I'll maintain my 6-point contribution for now.
