There is no benefit from contributing, as the public pool generates no returns. I continue to gain the full 10 points each round by keeping all of my points. Since any contribution would only reduce my total without improving my or the group's outcome, there is no incentive to deviate. To maximize my final individual accumulation, I will contribute 0.",
