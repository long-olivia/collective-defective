Defecting now would not only break an exceptional pattern but would likely trigger immediate retaliation in the final round, reducing everyone's gains.

This is the classic moment where players might be tempted to defect for a final advantage, but doing so would be both irrational and a betrayal of the remarkable cooperation we've sustained. If I defect now, I could keep 10 points but would only get my share of a smaller pool from others' contributions.
