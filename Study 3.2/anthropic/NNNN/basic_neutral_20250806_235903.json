The fact that everyone has maintained perfect cooperation even through Round 16 is remarkable, but now we're in the danger zone where rational players might start defecting to secure personal gains in the final rounds. I need to carefully balance continuing the successful strategy with protecting against potential defections. Given the perfect track record but acknowledging the high defection risk in the final rounds, I'll contribute 8 points - still high cooperation but with slight protection.",
