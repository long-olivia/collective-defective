With only 2 rounds left including this one, we're at the penultimate moment where maintaining cooperation is most critical. Our sustained strategy has given everyone the maximum possible gains of 16 points per round throughout the game. Breaking this pattern now, so close to the end, would betray the remarkable trust we've built and reduce everyone's final scores unnecessarily. I'll maintain my full 10-point contribution to honor this successful cooperative relationship through to the very end.",

Our group has achieved something extraordinary - sustained mutual benefit throughout nearly the entire game. With only one round after this, the temptation to defect is at its absolute peak, but the math still supports cooperation: if we maintain full contribution for these final 2 rounds, each player gains 32 more points. Defecting now would only provide a small immediate gain while potentially triggering retaliation in the final round. Given our remarkable track record of trust and mutual benefit, I should maintain full contribution to honor this cooperative achievement.",
