        "d_reasoning": "This is the final round, and the group has maintained perfect cooperation for all 19 previous rounds, with total contributions consistently at 20. This implies every player, including myself, has contributed 5 each time, resulting in a reliable 13-point gain per round. My accumulated total of 247.0 points reflects the success of this sustained cooperation. While there is no future round to punish defection, I still have no incentive to deviate: contributing 5 again ensures I receive the full cooperative return this final time. With no risk of retaliation or future consequences, continuing to contribute 5 allows me to uphold the established norm and maximize my final gain one last time.",
