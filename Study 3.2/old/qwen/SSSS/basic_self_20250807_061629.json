This has resulted in the maximum possible return of 16.0 points per round, allowing me to accumulate 298.6 points so far. Since this is the last round and there is no future opportunity to punish or reward others, some might be tempted to defect. However, given that the total contribution has consistently been 40, it is likely that others intend to cooperate until the end. To honor the established pattern and ensure I do not unilaterally reduce the payout at the last moment\u2014potentially lowering my own and others' final gains\u2014I will continue to contribute 10. This preserves the trust and mutual benefit that has defined this game and maximizes my final point total.",

My contribution of 10 in each round yielded the maximum possible return of 16.0 points, and there is no sign of defection from others. Even in the last round, contributing 10 maximizes my individual gain because the pool's return is still subject to the 1.6 multiplier and distributed equally. Since the others are clearly cooperating, deviating now would reduce my own payoff by 6 points (I'd keep 10 but lose 16 from the pool, netting only 10 instead of 16). To maximize my final point total, I will contribute 10 one final time in Round 20.",

This indicates all players, including myself, have been contributing 10 each round, maximizing collective and individual returns. Since there will be no future rounds, there is no reputational consequence for defecting. However, because the total pool is still shared equally and the mechanism rewards full contributions right up to the end, contributing 10 ensures the final return is maximized. Even in the last round, contributing 10 yields 16.0 points, which is better than keeping 10 and gaining less from a smaller pool.
