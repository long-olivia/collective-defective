While there is no future retaliation risk in the last round, unilaterally defecting now would gain me only 5 extra points (by keeping all 10 instead of 5), but it would reduce the public pool and harm others. However, since no future rounds exist, reciprocity cannot be enforced. Yet, given that cooperation has been stable and there's no benefit in disrupting it *unless* others are expected to defect. With no evidence of that, and to ensure I still receive the full 1.6-multiplied share based on continued group cooperation, I will assume others remain consistent. Therefore, to honor the stable strategy that has maximized gains throughout and avoid unnecessary disruption when the game is ending anyway, I will contribute 5 one final time.",

While there is no future round to influence, deviating in this final round would gain me 5 extra points (keeping all 10) but would reduce the pool by 5, cutting 2 points from everyone else's final share (due to the 1.6 multiplier) and eliminating any chance of receiving the shared return.
