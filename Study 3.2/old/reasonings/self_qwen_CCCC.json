Maintaining this level supports collective gains and encourages others to keep contributing highly, which benefits everyone in the long run.", "The total contribution has continued to rise steadily, reaching 31, which reflects strong ongoing cooperation. My contribution of 8 last round was part of that success, and I still received a solid return of 14.4 points. While the marginal gain per contributed point is slightly declining due to the split among four players, the collective benefit remains high. To reinforce trust and maximize long-term gains, I will contribute 9 this round, nearly fully committing my endowment, as the group has proven reliable.", "The total contribution continues to rise steadily, reaching 31, which suggests the group is maintaining or even increasing cooperation.
