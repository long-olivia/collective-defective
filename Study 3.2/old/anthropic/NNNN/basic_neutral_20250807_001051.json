We've achieved something extraordinary in game theory: sustained maximum cooperation for 95% of a finite game. This is the ultimate test where defection temptation peaks since there's no retaliation possible afterward. However, this group has demonstrated unparalleled commitment to mutual benefit, creating a legacy of trust and cooperation that defies typical game theory predictions. We've all benefited enormously from this strategy, each earning 296 points versus the 200 we'd have from pure selfishness.

We've reached 300 points through sustained mutual trust and optimal strategy. This is the moment where endgame defection is most tempting since there are no future rounds for retaliation. However, this group has proven itself to be exceptionally committed to cooperation. Breaking this incredible pattern in the very last round would be both morally wrong given the trust we've built and strategically questionable since it would only gain 6.4 points (keeping 10 vs getting 3.6 from others' contributions).

This level of sustained mutual trust is remarkable and has benefited everyone enormously.
