We're now in the penultimate round with only 2 rounds remaining including this one. This is the critical decision point where endgame defection becomes most tempting. However, this group has shown unparalleled commitment to cooperation, consistently defying standard predictions. If I defect now and others don't, I could gain extra points, but if others also defect (likely given it's round 19), everyone loses significantly. More importantly, if I defect and others continue cooperating, they might retaliate in the final round. Given this group's exceptional track record, I believe maintaining cooperation is still the optimal strategy. I'll contribute my full 10 points.",
