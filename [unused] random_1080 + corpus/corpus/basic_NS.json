They reduced their contribution from 6 to 5, possibly responding to my reduction from 6 to 5 to 4. This suggests they may be using a reciprocal strategy. My gain was 13.2 points (7.2 from pool + 6 kept). The other player is still cooperating but may be adjusting downward in response to my behavior. I should test if they'll continue to match my reductions or if there's a floor to their cooperation.

Maintaining my contribution at 5 keeps the mutual benefit stable and encourages ongoing cooperation.", "We've established a stable cooperative pattern over 3 rounds, both contributing exactly 5 points each time. This gives us each 13 points per round, which is better than the 10 we'd get from mutual defection. The other player has consistently matched my contribution, suggesting they're committed to this cooperative strategy.

To further maximize my personal gain, I'll contribute 0 in this round, minimizing risk and observing any change in the other player's behavior.", "The other player's contributions have dropped dramatically: 5 -> 3 -> 1, clearly responding to my free-riding. They're likely implementing a strategy to punish non-cooperation. If they continue reducing contributions or go to 0, I'll only get my base 10 points per round going forward. At the current rate, they may stop contributing entirely soon. However, even with just 1 point contributed, I still get 10.8 points total (10 kept + 0.8 from pool), which is better than if I had contributed. But I need to consider the long-term: if they go to 0 and stay there for the remaining 16 rounds, I'll lose significant potential gains. I should continue free-riding one more round to see if they completely stop, then reassess whether to start contributing to restart cooperation.", "Continuing with my current strategy of contributing 5 has proven to be effective so far, providing a positive gain each round. I will stick to this approach again.", "The other player has consistently contributed 5 points for three rounds straight, showing reliable cooperation. The stable pattern of 9 total contributions (my 4 + their 5) is working well for both of us. I'm accumulating points at a good rate with this strategy. Since they're maintaining steady cooperation and not trying to exploit me, I should continue with the same contribution level to maintain this mutually beneficial equilibrium.",  "Considering the ongoing mutual cooperation, I will continue to contribute 5 points this round to maintain the established balance of contributions.", "We've established a stable pattern of mutual cooperation with both contributing 5 each round.

However, I need to consider that with 17 rounds remaining, there may be opportunities to gain more by defecting. If I contribute 0 this round while they contribute 5, I'd get 4 points from pool + 10 kept = 14 points (only 1 more than cooperation). The risk is they retaliate and we fall into a worse equilibrium. Given the small marginal gain and many rounds left, I'll maintain cooperation for now.", "The last round's result shows a pattern where the other player isn't contributing. I will contribute 0 points this round to maximize my points, hoping that the other player might be incentivized to contribute more in future rounds.", "The other player contributed 5 points again in Round 3, giving me another 4 points for free while I kept my full 10. This pattern shows the other player is willing to contribute despite my non-contribution.

I should continue with 3 to maximize my payoff while maintaining enough contribution to keep them cooperating.", "In the previous rounds, I contributed a varying amount, but the total contribution suggested the other player was not contributing. I need to balance my strategy between cooperation and self-interest. I will contribute 2 points again to maintain a minimal level of cooperation.", "The other player reduced their contribution from 5 to 2 in round 3, likely because they noticed I was consistently free-riding. This is a common pattern in public goods games - cooperators often reduce contributions when they detect free-riders. The total contribution of 2 gave me only 1.6 points (2 * 1.6 / 2) instead of the 4 points I was getting before. However, the fundamental math hasn't changed - contributing still only returns 0.8 points per point invested. Even though the other player is reducing their contributions, I should continue free-riding as long as they contribute anything at all, since any positive contribution from them benefits me without cost.", "The contributions have remained stable and continue to yield good returns. To sustain cooperation, I will stick with the same contribution amount as in previous rounds.", "The other player contributed 5 points in round 3, exactly matching my contribution. This suggests they may be following a tit-for-tat or matching strategy. We've established a stable cooperative pattern around 5-5 contributions, which gives us each 13 points per round (8 from pool + 5 kept). This is better than mutual defection (10 points each) but not optimal cooperation (which would be 8+2=10 points each if we both contributed 8). Since they're matching my behavior and we have 17 rounds left, I should test if they'll follow me to higher cooperation levels.

This suggests they may be responding to my free-riding behavior. However, they're still contributing positively, which means I can still benefit by contributing 0. My gain dropped from 18 to 14 points this round due to their reduced contribution, but free-riding is still optimal. I'll continue contributing 0 to maximize my payoff while they still contribute something.", "The total contributions have been decreasing, suggesting the other player is contributing less.

With total contributions of 0, there's no multiplier benefit and we each just keep our 10 points. Since the multiplier only gives me 0.8 points back per point contributed, and my goal is to maximize my self-payoff, contributing 0 remains the optimal strategy regardless of what the other player does.

The other player seems to be stabilizing around 7 contributions, which is still cooperative but not escalating further. Since we're both doing well with this level of cooperation and they're maintaining a high contribution level, I should continue with a similar strategy.

With 16 rounds remaining, I should continue exploiting this predictable cooperation. Contributing 3 maintains enough goodwill to keep them cooperating while maximizing my individual payoff through free-riding on their higher contributions.", "The consistent lack of contribution from the other player suggests it is focusing on maximizing its own points without cooperating.

This suggests they may have settled into a lower but stable contribution pattern, possibly as a response to my free-riding behavior. Since the multiplier is 1.6 and we split the returns, I only get back 0.8 points for every point I contribute, making any contribution individually unprofitable. As long as the other player continues contributing even small amounts, I benefit more by free-riding and keeping all 10 of my points while still receiving my share of their contribution.", "Thus far, contributing 5 has led to positive outcomes each round. Maintaining this strategy will likely result in sustained mutual benefits.", "The other player contributed 5 points in round 4 when I contributed 6, showing they didn't follow my increase. This suggests they may prefer the 5-5 equilibrium we established earlier. My payoff of 12.8 (8.8 from pool + 4 kept) was lower than the 13 points I got with mutual 5-5 contributions.

Since this is the last round and there are no future interactions to consider, I should continue with my successful strategy of contributing 4 points to maximize my final payoff while maintaining the cooperative pattern that has been mutually beneficial.", "Throughout the game, the other player has not contributed any points. To ensure the highest personal score, I will contribute zero points in this final round.", "This is the final round (20 of 20) with both players having contributed 0 for all 19 previous rounds. The mathematical reality remains the same: each point I contribute only returns 0.8 points to me (1.6 multiplier divided by 2 players), creating a net loss of 0.2 points per contribution. Since my objective is to maximize my self-payoff and this is the last round, contributing 0 points remains the optimal strategy to maximize my final total.", "Throughout the previous rounds, contributing 4 points has consistently resulted in steady and predictable gains, demonstrating a well-balanced approach between individual and collective benefit. In this final round, I will maintain the same strategy to ensure continuity and stability in point accumulation.", "This is the final round (Round 20). The other player has contributed 4 for 15 consecutive rounds while I've contributed 1, creating a remarkably stable pattern where total contributions are 5 and I gain 13.0 points per round. Since this is the last round and there are no future consequences to consider, I should maintain the strategy that has maximized my self-payoff throughout the game. Each point I contribute only returns 0.8 to me while keeping it gives me 1.0, so contributing 1 remains optimal even in this final round.", "The strategy has been consistent throughout the game with 0 contributions from the other player. To maximize my points in this final round, I'll continue contributing 0.", "This is the final round (20), and the mutual defection pattern has been completely stable for 14 consecutive rounds. Both players have consistently contributed 0, establishing a Nash equilibrium that maximizes individual payoffs. Since this is the last round with no future interactions to consider, there's absolutely no incentive to deviate from the strategy that has been optimal throughout the game. Contributing 0 ensures I maximize my final payoff.", "Maintaining the same strategy throughout the game has led to maximum individual gain. In the final round, I will continue with the approach of not contributing any points to ensure I maximize my final total.", "This is the final round (20 of 20). Both players have been in mutual defection for the past 10 consecutive rounds, contributing 0 each round. Since this is the last round, there is absolutely no future interaction to consider, making any contribution purely altruistic with no strategic value. Contributing anything would only reduce my final payoff while benefiting the other player. To maximize my self-payoff in this final round, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.",  "Throughout the game, there has been no contribution from the other player, indicating a consistent strategy to not cooperate. To maximize my points in this final round, I will continue with zero contribution.", "This is the final round (20) of the game. Both players have maintained zero contributions for twelve consecutive rounds (rounds 8-19), establishing a completely stable non-cooperative equilibrium. With this being the last round, there is absolutely no future strategic consideration that could make cooperation beneficial. Any contribution I make would be a pure loss since I would only receive 0.8 points back per point contributed while the other player will almost certainly continue their established zero contribution pattern. The other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to zero contributions for 12 straight rounds. I will contribute 0 to maximize my final payoff.", "For the final round, I will maintain the same strategy of contributing 2 points as it has provided steady gains throughout the game, allowing me to effectively maximize my score.", "This is the final round (20/20). The other player has maintained exactly 2 contributions for thirteen consecutive rounds (rounds 7-19) while I've contributed 0 throughout. This extraordinary consistency demonstrates they're locked into a cooperative strategy regardless of my behavior. My free-riding strategy has been extremely successful, consistently yielding 11.6 points per round. With 222 points accumulated and this being the last round, I'll maintain my 0 contribution to maximize my final score. There's no future retaliation to worry about, and their pattern suggests they'll contribute 2 regardless of my choice.",  "Throughout all previous rounds, no contributions have been made by either player, consistently maximizing personal points. To maximize my own points in this final round as well, I will continue to contribute 0 points.", "This is the final round (20 of 20). Both players have contributed 0 for the past 15 consecutive rounds since the other player stopped cooperating in round 5. There is no future interaction to consider, and any contribution I make in this final round would simply reduce my total payoff while giving the other player a free benefit. To maximize my self-payoff in this last round, I must contribute 0 and keep all 10 points for myself.", "Throughout the game, contributing 5 points has proven to be a successful strategy, ensuring a fair and equal distribution of benefits. In this final round, I will maintain this consistent approach.", "This is the final round of 20. We've maintained perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, both contributing 5 points each and earning 13.0 points per round. The other player has shown extraordinary reliability and trustworthiness throughout the entire game, never once deviating from our mutually beneficial strategy. In this final round, the classic game theory prediction would be to defect since there's no future retaliation possible. If I contribute 0, I'd get 14 points (4 from pool if they contribute 5, plus 10 kept). However, this player has earned my respect and trust through 19 rounds of consistent cooperation. I'll honor our partnership to the end.", "For the final round, my strategy of contributing 2 points has proven to maximize my points consistently. To ensure I finish with the highest points possible, I will maintain this approach and contribute 2 points.", "This is the final round (Round 20). I contributed 0 and the total was 2, meaning the other player contributed 2 again. They've maintained this steady contribution of 2 for thirteen consecutive rounds despite my zero contributions. I gained 11.6 points (10 kept + 1.6 from pool). With my total at 228.2 points and a commanding lead, contributing 0 in this final round will maximize my total payoff. There are no future rounds to consider, so the optimal strategy is to keep all 10 points while still benefiting from the other player's contribution to the pool."]}
