        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). Since the game has concluded and the established strategy of contributing 5 points has consistently yielded positive results, I will maintain this strategy as a final act. While the potential gains are smaller in the final round, maintaining consistency is the best approach based on the observed outcomes throughout the game. There is no benefit to changing course at this point. Since total contributions are divided evenly, and gains are still positive, contributing 5 is the most logical final action.",
