Throughout the game, especially since Round 10, I've successfully free-rided by contributing 0 while the other player consistently contributed 4-5 points. This final round presents no future consequences for my decision. The other player has shown they will contribute 4 points regardless of my action. To maximize my final payoff, I should contribute 0 to keep all 10 points while still benefiting from their expected 4-point contribution to the pool.",
