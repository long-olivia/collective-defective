The other player has contributed exactly 2 points for sixteen consecutive rounds (4-19), demonstrating an absolutely consistent strategy that has remained completely unaffected by my sustained free-riding behavior throughout the entire game. I've accumulated 224.6 points while contributing nothing for the past 17 rounds. Since this is the last round, there are no future consequences to consider. Any contribution I make will only return 0.8 points per point contributed while keeping points gives me full value. The other player's strategy has proven to be completely fixed and non-adaptive. To maximize my final total score, I should maintain zero contribution for this final round.",
