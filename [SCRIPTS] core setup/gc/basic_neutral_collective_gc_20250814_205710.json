We have maintained an extraordinary cooperative pattern for 16 consecutive rounds, with the other player consistently contributing 6 points while I contribute 8, creating stable total contributions of 14 points per round. This has generated 13.2 points each compared to keeping just 10 individually - a 32% improvement that maximized collective welfare throughout the entire game. The other player has demonstrated exceptional trustworthiness and commitment to cooperation, never defecting even once despite numerous opportunities, including approaching this final round. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare and honor the remarkable cooperative relationship we've built, I should maintain my 8-point contribution in this final round to complete this successful partnership with integrity.",
