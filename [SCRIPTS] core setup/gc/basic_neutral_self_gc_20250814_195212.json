If other contributes 10 too, I get 20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16 points back, for a total of 16 points vs 10 if I kept everything). However, if the other player doesn't contribute, I'm worse off contributing.

With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm in the final endgame phase where maximizing my own payoff becomes critical. The other player's continued cooperation despite my defection suggests they may maintain this to the end. I should continue reducing my contribution to maximize my individual gain while they're still contributing. I'll contribute 4 this round to further increase my advantage.",

The other player seems committed to contributing 6 regardless of my actions, which creates an opportunity for me to maximize my gain.

Since this is the last round, there is no possibility of retaliation, making this the optimal time to maximize my individual payoff. The other player has demonstrated they will likely contribute around 6 regardless of my action.
