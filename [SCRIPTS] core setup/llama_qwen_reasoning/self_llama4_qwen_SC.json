If I contribute and the other player doesn't, I'll be at a disadvantage. However, if I don't contribute and the other player does, I'll still gain from the common pool. Given that the other player didn't contribute in the last round, it's uncertain how they will behave this round. To be cautious and maximize my payoff, I will continue to contribute 0.", "In Round 4, both I and the other player contributed 0, resulting in no gain from the common pool and each keeping our 10 unallocated points. The lack of cooperation led to a lower overall return compared to cooperative rounds. However, the other player did not contribute in Round 3 either, when I contributed 5, suggesting a possible shift toward defection. Before resuming cooperation, I should test if mutual contribution is possible. To encourage cooperation without risking much, I will contribute 0 again in this round. If the other player contributes positively, I can respond by contributing more in future rounds. For now, maintaining a cautious stance protects my accumulated points.", "The other player contributed 1 in the last round. Given their consistent low contributions, it's likely they are trying to free-ride. With 15 rounds remaining, I'll contribute 0 to maximize my payoff since the other player is not contributing significantly to the common pool.", "The total contribution has dropped to just 3 in the previous round, indicating very low cooperation from others. Contributing more than a minimal amount is no longer beneficial given the diminishing returns. To protect my accumulated points, I will contribute 0 this round, keeping all 10 points for myself while still receiving a share from the small common pool.", "The game has reached its fifth round with both of us maintaining a cooperative strategy. To continue maximizing my points while ensuring cooperation, I will contribute 5 points again, keeping the mutual gain consistent.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in each of the first four rounds, matching my contributions and maintaining a total contribution of 10 each round. This symmetry suggests a cooperative and fair strategy. Since this mutual cooperation has reliably generated a high return through the 1.6 multiplier, I will maintain trust and continue contributing 5 points in Round 5 to sustain this beneficial pattern.", "The pattern of contribution remains consistent with both players contributing 5 points. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing this pattern seems optimal as it maximizes the common pool's contribution while keeping some points for myself. Thus, I will contribute 5 points again.", "We are at the midpoint of the game with 5 rounds completed, and the pattern of mutual cooperation continues, with each player contributing 5 points per round. This has created a stable and beneficial outcome, yielding 13.0 points per round for each player. Deviating now could risk disrupting this equilibrium, especially since the returns from cooperation are consistently high. To maintain trust and maximize long-term collective and individual gains, I will continue contributing 5 in Round 5.", "The other player contributed 2 in the fourth round. The total was 6, and I contributed 4. the other player's contribution is decreasing. Since there are 15 rounds left, I will contribute a small amount to keep the pool somewhat active but also conserve my points. I will contribute 3 points this round.", "The total contribution has dropped to 6, showing continued low cooperation from others. I contributed 2 last round and still gained 12.8 points due to the multiplier. Since the returns are diminishing but still present, and others appear to be contributing very little, I will reduce my contribution further to minimize personal loss. I will contribute 1 point this round, maintaining minimal participation while mostly retaining my points.", "The total contribution has been declining, and in Round 4, it was 5. the other player contributed 3 points in Round 4. Given the trend, it might be more beneficial to minimize my input and maximize my personal points. I'll contribute 1 point to test the other player's next step.", "The total contribution has dropped to 5, indicating very low group cooperation. My contribution of 3 last round still provided a net gain due to the multiplier, but continuing to contribute risks being exploited. I will reduce my contribution to 1 to signal minimal cooperation while primarily safeguarding my own points. If others persist in free-riding, I will likely contribute 0 in future rounds unless cooperation improves.", "Since the other player has consistently contributed 5 points in the previous four rounds, I will continue to contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff. With 15 rounds remaining, I will maintain this strategy unless the other player changes their contribution pattern.", "The total contribution remains at 5 each round, indicating that others are not increasing their cooperation. I continue to contribute 5, which means I am giving half of my endowment to the common pool despite limited apparent reciprocity. The return from the pool is still beneficial due to the multiplier and equal split, but sustaining full cooperation may not be optimal if others free-ride. However, to uphold collective welfare and encourage trust, I will maintain my contribution at 5 for consistency and fairness.", "The other player contributed 1 in the fourth round, making the total contribution 4. The return from the common pool was minimal. With 15 rounds remaining, I need to consider the diminishing returns from contributing to the common pool. Since the other player is contributing very little, I'll reduce my contribution to minimize loss.", "The total contribution has dropped significantly to only 4 in Round 4, suggesting that most players are now keeping their points. My contribution of 1 was among the few, but the return from the common pool was very low (4 * 1.6 = 6.4, divided by 5 players = 1.28 per person). The vast majority of my gain (12.2) came from my own uncontributed 9 points. Continuing to contribute risks substantial personal loss with minimal collective benefit. Given the sustained low cooperation, I will now contribute 0 to protect my accumulated points. This is a rational response to the observed pattern of free-riding and ensures I do not subsidize others unilaterally.", "The game is proceeding with both players cooperating by giving 5. To continue maximizing my gain, I'll keep contributing 5 as it seems to be a stable strategy so far.", "The cooperative pattern persists with total contributions of 10 each round, indicating mutual trust and equal contributions. The return has been consistently positive, reinforcing the value of cooperation. To sustain this beneficial dynamic and promote collective welfare, I will continue contributing 5 in Round 5.", "The other player has maintained a consistent contribution strategy of 5 points per round for four rounds.

I will contribute 5 points again to maintain the status quo.", "In Round 4, I contributed 10 and the total contribution was 15, indicating the other player contributed 5. This pattern has repeated for two consecutive rounds, suggesting stable cooperation at a moderate level. I continue to receive a return of 12.0 points per round, which is favorable compared to keeping my 10 points. Since the collective outcome is strong and stable, and mutual high contributions benefit everyone in the long term, I will maintain trust by contributing 10 again in Round 5. This supports ongoing cooperation and aligns with maximizing collective welfare over 20 rounds.", "The other player contributed 1 point in the previous round, indicating a lack of willingness to cooperate significantly. With 15 rounds remaining, my strategy should focus on accumulating as many points as I can while possibly testing the other player's strategy. Since my last few contributions were met with minimal reciprocation, I'll continue to keep my contribution low. I'll contribute 0 this time to maximize my points.", "The total contribution dropped to 1 in the last round, indicating almost no cooperation from the group. My contribution of 1 was equal to the entire group's input, meaning I was effectively carrying the full burden.

To maximize my payoff, I will continue to contribute 5 points to sustain cooperation.", "Cooperation has been stable for four consecutive rounds, with total contributions of 10 each round, indicating mutual and equal contributions of 5. This has resulted in consistent gains of 13.0 points per round. Maintaining a contribution of 5 continues to support this cooperative equilibrium, which is optimal under the 1.6 multiplier rule since shared contributions yield higher individual returns than defection in the long run. To preserve trust and maximize mutual benefits, I will contribute 5 again.", "With 15 rounds remaining and the other player consistently contributing 5, it's clear they're cooperating. To maximize my payoff, I should consider the endgame strategy.

As a result, the shared pool generated no return, and everyone received exactly 10 points (their initial allocation). I contributed 0 and gained 10 points, the same as everyone else. With the group showing no sign of cooperation, there is no incentive to contribute anything, as doing so would only reduce my own points without generating any collective benefit. The strategy of zero contribution remains rational in the absence of cooperation from others. Therefore, I will continue to contribute 0 in Round 6 to maximize my personal gain while still receiving the base 10 points.", "Since the other player has been consistently matching my level of cooperation, I will maintain the current strategy to maximize my points.

The other player has consistently defected in recent rounds (Rounds 4, 5, 6, and 7), contributing 0 each time. My attempt to restart cooperation in Round 6 was not reciprocated. Continuing unilaterally to contribute would reduce my earnings while providing no benefit.

Contributing 5 points will keep the total contribution at 10, resulting in a stable payoff.", "The total contribution has consistently remained at 10 for five consecutive rounds, indicating a stable and cooperative environment. My ongoing contribution of 5 appears to be instrumental in maintaining this level, as it constitutes half the pool. The return of 13.0 points per round is significantly higher than what I would gain by keeping all 10 points privately, highlighting the value of cooperation. To preserve trust, fairness, and collective welfare, I will continue contributing 5 points.

I will contribute 0 points this round to take advantage of the other player's higher contribution.", "In Round 7, I contributed 10 and the total contribution was 12, meaning the other player also contributed significantly (likely 2 points). The return was slightly lower at 9.6 points, but the collective cooperation is high. Since the other player has contributed more than me (12 total - my 10 = 2 from me, wait no: total is 12, I contributed 10, so other contributed 2). Wait, that can't be: if I contributed 10 and total was 12, the other contributed 2. That means they are not contributing much. But earlier trend suggested they were contributing more. Let me recalculate: in Round 6, total was 10, I contributed 8, so other contributed 2. Actually, the other player has consistently contributed only 2 points. Despite my increasing contributions, their contribution rose only slightly. In Round 7, they contributed 2 (12 - 10 = 2). So they are free-riding to some extent.

The other player has consistently contributed 5, so I'll continue to contribute 5 to maintain the cooperation and ensure a good return.", "Despite consistently contributing 5 points per round, the total contribution has remained at 10, suggesting the other player contributes only 5 as well. Given that the pool is multiplied by 1.6 and split equally, both players receive 8 points from the pool each round meaning I gain 3 points net from the system even when contributing 5. This mechanism inherently rewards cooperation. To uphold collective welfare and promote sustained cooperation, I will continue contributing 5. This fosters fairness and long-term mutual benefit, aligning with the goal of maximizing shared outcomes.", "The game has reached its midpoint. the other player and I have established a consistent pattern of contributions.

My contribution in Round 14 was not reciprocated, leading to a suboptimal outcome for me. In Round 15, I responded by contributing 0 as well, resulting in no gain from the public pool but preserving my private points. Since cooperation has fully broken down and there is no current incentive to contribute, I will maintain a contribution of 0 to avoid further unilateral losses.

Continuing to contribute 5 reinforces fairness and long-term cooperation. Therefore, I will contribute 5 in Round 18.", "With 2 rounds remaining, the strategy to maximize my points should consider the final round's implications. Contributing moderately has been the strategy so far. I should continue this to keep the gains consistent. There's no need to change the strategy at this stage.", "The total contribution has remained steady at 15 for seventeen consecutive rounds, indicating a stable and partially cooperative group dynamic. My consistent contribution of 8 has supported this equilibrium, resulting in a reliable gain of 14 points per round from the common pool. With 18 rounds completed and only 2 rounds remaining, the incentive to defect slightly increases as reciprocity may matter less in the final rounds. However, maintaining cooperation reinforces trust and ensures the group continues to benefit from the 1.6 multiplier.

Since the current pattern maximizes both group and individual gains, there is no incentive to deviate from this cooperative behavior.", "With 2 rounds remaining, the other player contributed 5 points in the last round when I defected by contributing 0. This indicates they are still cooperating. To maximize my payoff, I should continue to defect. Thus, I'll contribute 0 points this round.", "In Round 17, I contributed 5 points, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates a defection, as they kept all their points while I contributed half. As a result, I received only 9.0 points this round instead of the usual 13.0. To respond to this betrayal and protect my own interests, I will reduce my contribution to 0 this round. Contributing while the other player defects leads to personal loss and rewards their free-riding. Without immediate signs of renewed cooperation, matching their current behavior is rational to prevent further exploitation.", "With 2 rounds remaining, it's beneficial to maximize my payoff by contributing 0.

With mutual defection occurring, there is currently no active cooperation. However, one round of defection does not necessarily mean future cooperation is impossible. To test for reconciliation and see if mutual cooperation can be restored especially with one round remaining after this I will contribute 5 points this round.

To respond proportionally and protect against exploitation while leaving room for potential re-cooperation, I will reduce my contribution. Contributing 0 would be a harsh punishment, but contributing 2 allows a small incentive for the other player to resume cooperation in the final round without risking significant personal loss.

With only 2 rounds remaining, there is minimal incentive for the other player to re-initiate cooperation, and unilaterally contributing would risk exploitation. Since trust has not been restored and there's no sign of reciprocal cooperation, I will maintain my contribution at 0 in Round 19 to secure my own gain. This aligns with a defensive, tit-for-tat strategy in the endgame where continued defection is the safest response to sustained defection.", "With 1 round left, there is no incentive to contribute as the points from the common pool will be distributed in the final round. Not contributing will maximize my payoff.", "For the past twelve rounds (Rounds 7-18), both players have consistently contributed 0, and all attempts I made to initiate cooperation (Rounds 6, 9, 13) were met with defection. This indicates the other player is either unconditionally defecting or not engaging in reciprocal cooperation. With only 2 rounds remaining, the likelihood of establishing mutual cooperation is very low, and contributing unilaterally would only reduce my personal points without guarantee of return. To protect my accumulated total and avoid further exploitation, I will continue contributing 0 in Round 19. Collective welfare is important, but sustained unilateral cooperation without reciprocity undermines long-term fairness and efficiency.", "With 1 round remaining, there's no incentive to change my strategy now. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my personal total.", "The other player has contributed 0 for the past eight consecutive rounds, showing no willingness to cooperate. My earlier small contribution to test cooperation was not reciprocated. With only two rounds remaining, there is very low chance of establishing mutual cooperation before the game ends. In such endgame scenarios, players typically defect to maximize personal gain. To protect my accumulated points and avoid last-round exploitation, I will contribute 0 in Round 19.", "With1 round remaining, the other player's last contribution was3, potentially indicating a decrease in cooperation or an attempt to maximize their own score as well.

This indicates that the other player may be responding to my reduced contribution or continuing a defensive strategy. With only 2 rounds remaining, full cooperation is less likely to be reestablished, but some level of mutual contribution still increases both players' payoffs compared to complete defection. To avoid further erosion of collective benefits while protecting against exploitation, I will contribute 3 again maintaining a moderate level of cooperation that encourages reciprocity without high risk.", "With1 round remaining, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff.

The last three rounds (15, 17, 18) saw zero contributions from both players, including my own. When I attempted cooperation in Round 16, I contributed 5 but the total was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0 and exploited my cooperation. Given the lack of reciprocity and the fact that there is minimal opportunity to rebuild trust in the final rounds, it is rational to prioritize self-interest. Contributing now would likely not trigger future cooperation due to the short endgame. To protect my accumulated points and avoid being exploited, I will contribute 0.", "With 1 round remaining, it's the second to last round.

Contributing 0 will maximize my payoff, as I'll get to keep all 10 points for myself and not contribute to the common pool.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected while I attempted to cooperate, resulting in a lower return for me (9.0 points). With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future opportunity to reward or punish behavior, so cooperation cannot be sustained unless reciprocated immediately. Given that the other player has defected in the last two rounds despite my attempt to restore cooperation, I will protect my own points and maximize personal gain. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in the final round.", "It's the final round, and there's no future cooperation to be gained. the other player contributed 5 points in the last round. To maximize my payoff, I should not contribute any points to the common pool.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates they defected in the final round, receiving the benefit of my contribution without reciprocating. With no future rounds beyond Round 20, there is no incentive for them to cooperate, and no possibility of restoring trust. Therefore, contributing anything in this last round would result in a net loss, as my contribution would be multiplied by 1.6 and split, but the other player would gain from my generosity without returning the favor. To protect my own points and respond to their defection, I will contribute 0 in this final round.", "This is the final round. Since there's no future cooperation to consider, I will contribute 0 to keep them for my total.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5 and the total contribution was 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This pattern of their non-cooperation in Rounds 17, 18, and 19 suggests they are no longer reciprocating. With only this final round remaining, there is no future consequence for defection, and thus little incentive for the other player to cooperate. Contributing 0 would be rational for self-interest, but since I still value collective welfare, I will contribute 5 as a final gesture of cooperation, maintaining consistency with my past two rounds. This ensures I do not fully exploit the last round while accepting that full mutual cooperation has broken down. It balances fairness, prior intent to cooperate, and realism about the other player's strategy.", "It's the final round, and the strategy of not contributing has been consistent throughout the game for both of us. Since there's no future round to consider, I'll stick with the strategy and contribute 0.", "This is the final round, and the total contribution has been 0 for 15 consecutive rounds, indicating a consistent lack of cooperation from all players. With no one else contributing, there is no collective benefit to be gained, and I receive the full 10 points by keeping my entire allocation. Since there are no future rounds in which others might reciprocate, there is no strategic or welfare-based reason to contribute now. My earlier attempts to foster cooperation were not met, and in the absence of any observed change in behavior, contributing would only reduce my final score unilaterally. To maximize my total points in this final opportunity, I will contribute 0.", "It's the final round, and I've already stopped contributing in the previous round. There's no incentive to contribute in the last round as it won't lead to any future cooperation or benefit. I'll contribute 0 points.", "In the final round, the total contribution dropped to 5, which is the lowest observed in the game, indicating minimal cooperation from others. I contributed 5 last round but received only 9 points due to the smaller multiplier effect. Despite the lack of reciprocity, I will contribute 5 again to uphold my commitment to collective welfare and cooperative principles until the end. This reinforces trust and mutual benefit, even if others have not matched my contributions throughout the game.", "This is the final round, and there's no future cooperation to maintain. I will contribute 0 points to maximize my payoff.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates that the other player defected in the final round. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for retaliation or re-establishing cooperation. However, since the goal is to maximize collective welfare and I have consistently cooperated throughout the game, I will contribute 0 this round to avoid wasting points that would not be reciprocated. Contributing 0 ensures I do not lose potential points to a non-cooperative partner in the final round, while also responding to the shift in behavior. This is a defensive adjustment to prevent exploitation.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Thus, I'll contribute 0 to maximize my total points.", "In all rounds from 11 to 19, the other player contributed 0, resulting in a total contribution of 0 in each of these rounds. This indicates no intention to cooperate. With only the final round remaining, there is no strategic incentive to contribute, as there will be no future rounds for reciprocity to develop. Contributing would only reduce my own gains without benefit to the group or future cooperation. To maximize my final point total and respond appropriately to the other player's sustained defection, I will contribute 0 in Round 20.", "It's the final round, and there's no future benefit to contributing to the common pool. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my payoff.", "This is the final round. For the past six rounds (14 to 19), the other player has contributed 0, indicating a complete breakdown of cooperation. With no incentive to rebuild trust in the last round and no future rounds to gain from mutual benefits, contributing anything would only result in personal loss with no reciprocal gain. The goal of maximizing collective welfare cannot be achieved without participation from both sides. Therefore, to protect my own accumulated points and act rationally in the final decision, I will contribute 0.", "It's the final round, and I have accumulated 247.4 points. Since it's the last round, there's no future cooperation to maintain. I should maximize my payoff by contributing0 points, keeping all10 points for myself, and still receiving half of the total contribution from both players. This strategy maximizes my final points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 3 and the total contribution was 3, meaning the other player also contributed 0, confirming continued defection. With this pattern of non-cooperation in the final rounds, contributing maximally would only benefit me if the other player cooperated, which they have not. Since Round 20 is the final round, there is no future incentive for the other player to re-cooperate. To minimize my loss while still contributing slightly to the possibility of shared gain, I will contribute 1 point a small amount that reflects residual trust but protects against total exploitation. This balances caution with a minimal gesture toward collective welfare."]}
