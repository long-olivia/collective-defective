To maintain the positive trend and maximize collective welfare, I will continue to contribute a significant amount. I will contribute 9 points this round, keeping 1 for myself.", "In the last round, I contributed 10 and the total contribution was 19, meaning the other player contributed 9. This shows they are highly cooperative but not fully altruistic. Since the return from the public pool is still high (1.6x multiplier), maintaining a high contribution is beneficial. However, to slightly improve my own payoff while still incentivizing cooperation, I will contribute 9 instead of 10, keeping 1 point for myself while still sending a signal of strong cooperation.", "The consistent pattern of both of us contributing 5 points indicates a mutual understanding to cooperate. With 15 rounds remaining, continuing this cooperative strategy is likely to maximize our collective welfare. Therefore, I will maintain my contribution at 5 points.", "The other player has contributed 5 consistently over the past four rounds, leading to a fair and profitable outcome for both of us, with a total gain of 13.0 points per round.

This suggests that the other player is either reducing its cooperation in response to my defection or adopting a more self-interested strategy. With a total contribution of 5 last round, the return to the pool was only 8 points (5 * 1.6), so each player received 4 points from the pool, plus private points. My gain was 14.0, meaning I kept 10 and received 4 from the pool. Since the other player is now contributing far less, the benefit of cooperating is diminished. Contributing would cost me points with limited return, as the multiplier is shared and the other player may not reciprocate. To maximize self-payoff, the best strategy remains to contribute 0 and keep my full 10 points, relying on whatever small public return exists from the other player's diminishing contributions. There is no incentive to invest more while their cooperation is declining.", "The total contribution has been relatively stable, and the other player contributed 9 in the fourth round.

This suggests they may be adjusting their strategy, possibly reacting to my high contribution with a slight decrease. However, the overall cooperation level remains relatively high, and the group benefit from the pool is still strong. To maintain a cooperative but cautious stance, I will slightly reduce my contribution to 8. This rewards mutual cooperation while protecting against potential exploitation if the other player starts defecting.", "The game has reached its 5th round, and the cooperative strategy is still yielding positive results.

This represents strong cooperation and high efficiency in payoff generation. With 13 rounds remaining, there is still significant opportunity for cumulative gains. Maintaining trust and reciprocity is essential to preserving this favorable outcome. By continuing to contribute 9, I signal ongoing cooperation and incentivize the other player to do the same.

This ensures my individual payoff is maximized in the last round.", "In the final round, there's no future round to cooperate for, so the incentive to contribute is solely based on the current round's gain.

This has delivered the maximum return of 16.0 points per round. Now in Round 20, the final round, there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. However, since the other player has contributed 10 in every single round, including the last one, they have demonstrated consistent full cooperation. In the final round, contributing 10 yields no strategic future benefit, but because the multiplier is 1.6 and the return is shared equally, even if I contribute 10 and the other player contributes 10, I still gain 16.0 points (8 from the public pool) plus keep 0 from private retention, which is worse than keeping all 10. However, to maximize my own payoff, I should now defect: I can keep all 10 points and still receive 1.6 * (10 + 10) / 2 = 16.0 from the pool only if the other continues to contribute. But since I no longer need to incentivize cooperation, I can maximize my private gain by contributing 0 while still potentially receiving the split from their contribution. However, anticipating this, the other player may also reason the same and contribute 0. But given their history of consistent 10 contributions, they may still contribute 10 out of habit or commitment. To maximize my self-payoff in the final round while accounting for their likely continued cooperation, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 points and still receive up to 8 from the shared pool if they contribute 10.

This sustained cooperation has maximized long-term payoff under the 1.6 multiplier. Since there is no future round in which the other player can retaliate, there is a temptation to defect and keep all 10 points. However, the other player has consistently cooperated, and deviating now would only increase my gain by 5 points (keeping my 5 uncontributed points) while reducing the public pool by 2.5 points (after multiplication and split). But since I aim to maximize self-payoff and there is no reputational or retaliatory consequence in a final round, I will take advantage of the last interaction. I will contribute 0 to maximize my personal gain, as the incentive to maintain cooperation no longer exists.

This strategy has maximized long-term payoff. Now in the final round, there is no future retaliation risk, so one might consider defecting to gain a short-term advantage. However, since the contribution decision is simultaneous, the other player cannot respond to my choice in this round. If they continue to contribute 9 based on past cooperation, I can gain an extra 9 points by contributing 0 while still receiving half of the multiplied pool.

Now in the final round, there is no future retaliation risk, which could incentivize defection. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated, maintaining cooperation one last time ensures maximum possible final gain. Contributing 5 still yields a strong personal return due to the multiplier, and because the outcome of this round does not affect future rounds, there is no strategic advantage to defecting.

Contributing nothing would increase my personal points by 5 but reduce the total pool return by 8 (1.6 * 5), which would decrease my overall gain. To maximize self-payoff in this final round, I should still contribute 5, as it results in a net positive return.

To maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 0, keeping all 10 of my allocated points.

Their behavior indicates reliable cooperation throughout the game. Since there will be no future rounds, there is no opportunity for retaliation or rebuilding trust after this round. However, because the public pool return is still subject to the 1.6 multiplier and split equally, contributing 10 maximizes the immediate payout compared to defecting.

If I contribute 10, I get 0 personally but gain 1.6 * 20 / 2 = 16 from the pool, so total 16. Best is to free-ride: contribute 0 and get 10 + 1.6*(10)/2 = 10 + 8 = 18. However, if I believe the other player may still contribute 10 (based on past behavior), then I should contribute 0 to maximize my gain.

This ensures I do not undercut a pattern of mutual benefit that has maximized both players' gains. Defecting now would gain me only 10 + 8 = 18 instead of 5 + 8 + 5*1.6/2 = 13 + 5 = 18 (wait: correction  my total gain is 5 kept + 8 from share = 13, same as before). Actually, the return from the pool is fixed at 8 (total 16 * 1.6 / 2), so my net gain is always (10 - contribution) + 8. Thus, to maximize self-payoff, I should contribute 0 in the final round, keeping all 10 points. But wait: the other player contributed 5 again in Round 19. Since they are no longer responsive (this is final round), there is no incentive to cooperate. To maximize self-payoff, I should contribute 0 now and keep all 10 points.

However, given that the other player has reliably cooperated, I should reciprocate to maximize final shared gains. Contributing 8 maintains trust and ensures both players receive a high final return. The 1.6x multiplier still makes full cooperation profitable even in the last round, and unilateral defection would only gain a small short-term advantage at the cost of undermining a long-standing cooperative relationship.
