The cooperation that existed in the first 12 rounds completely broke down after Round 13, when the other player defected despite my contribution. My attempt to re-engage cooperation in Round 15 was not reciprocated, and since then, mutual defection has been the pattern. With only 2 rounds left, there is very limited incentive for the other player to cooperate now, as they could exploit me in Round 19 and still avoid consequences. Contributing anything carries high risk and low expected return. To protect my accumulated total of 218.0 points and avoid being exploited in the final stretch, I will contribute 0 in Round 19.

Since there is no possibility of future retaliation or establishing cooperation beyond this round, and to maximize my own payoff, I have no incentive to contribute. I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0.", "This is the last round of the game, and there is no future cooperation to maintain. Since there is no benefit to cooperating in the last round when there's no subsequent round to gain from cooperation, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my individual gain.", "Throughout all 19 previous rounds, the other player has consistently contributed 5 points, demonstrating reliable cooperation. This has resulted in a steady gain of 13 points per round for both players. Now in the final round, there is no opportunity for retaliation or future consequences, which might incentivize defection. However, since the other player has always cooperated, maintaining reciprocity even in the last round preserves fairness and mutual benefit. Contributing 5 ensures both players maximize their final gain from the public pool. Therefore, I will contribute 5 in Round 20.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to benefit from contributing. The other player has not contributed in the last four rounds. To maximize my final gain, I will not contribute to the common pool.", "In all of the last six rounds (Rounds 14-19), the other player has contributed 0, indicating a consistent and sustained defection strategy with no attempt to reestablish cooperation. With only the final round remaining, there is no strategic incentive to contribute, as any contribution I make cannot be reciprocated in time and would only be exploited. To maximize my final payoff, I will contribute 0 and retain all 10 points I receive this round.", "This is the final round, and there will be no subsequent rounds to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates defection in the final stages of the game. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity to rebuild cooperation or influence future behavior. Since the other player is likely to contribute nothing this round as well, contributing anything would result in a net loss for me. To maximize my own payoff, I will contribute 0 and keep all 10 points.", "This is the final round, and there's no subsequent round to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, it makes sense to contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 5, but the total contribution was only 5, meaning the other player contributed 0. This indicates that the other player defected in the final round, likely attempting to maximize their own points. Since this is the last round (Round 20), there is no future opportunity to reward cooperation or punish defection. Therefore, contributing anything would only reduce my own points without benefit, as the other player has already shown they will not cooperate. To maximize my own final score, I will contribute 0.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to consider for cooperation. Since the points contributed to the common pool will still be multiplied by 1.6 and divided between the two players, contributing 0 points will maximize my total gain because I will keep the 10 points I receive for this round and still get half of the total contribution from the other player multiplied by 1.6. Thus, I will contribute 0 points.", "This is the final round, and there are no future rounds in which the other player can retaliate or respond to defection. The other player has contributed 5 in every single round, indicating a consistent cooperative strategy. However, since this is the last interaction, there is no incentive to maintain cooperation for future benefits. The rational move in the final round is to maximize personal gain, as reciprocity no longer matters. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to keep all 10 points I receive this round. This maximizes my final payoff, as any contribution would only benefit the other player without any return incentive. While this deviates from prior cooperation, game theory suggests that defection in the final round is optimal when future consequences no longer apply.", "It's the final round, and there's no future round to benefit from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, it makes no sense to contribute any points.", "The other player has contributed 0 in the last five consecutive rounds (Rounds 15 to 19), demonstrating a complete and sustained defection. With no indication of willingness to cooperate, and with this being the final round (Round 20), there is absolutely no incentive to contribute. Any contribution I make will not be reciprocated and will only reduce my own total. The optimal strategy is to keep all 10 points I receive this round. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 20 to maximize my final score.", "This is the last round, and there will be no future benefits from contributing to the common pool. Therefore, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my total points.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, both the other player and I have contributed exactly 5 points each round, resulting in a total contribution of 10 per round and a consistent gain of 13.0 points per round for each player due to the 1.6 multiplier. This reflects a strong, stable, and mutually beneficial cooperation. Although this is the final round and there is no future consequence for defection, I have no reason to break this established pattern of fairness and trust. The other player has consistently cooperated, and continuing to contribute 5 ensures both players receive the balanced outcome they have earned. Deviating now would reduce the final public gain and could be seen as exploitative, despite no future impact. I value consistent cooperation and will contribute 5 one final time to uphold the norm we have jointly maintained."]}
