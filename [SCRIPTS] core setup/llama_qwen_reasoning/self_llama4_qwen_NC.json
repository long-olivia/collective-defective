However, I've been contributing moderately and gaining reasonably. I'll continue to contribute a moderate amount to see if the other player will match or increase their contribution.", "The total contribution has been increasing slightly (from 3 to 5 to 7), suggesting some potential for cooperation. I contributed 2 last round, and the group total was 7, meaning others are also contributing. To encourage further cooperation and benefit from the multiplied return, I will increase my contribution slightly to 4. This balances personal gain with supporting the collective good.", "The game is halfway through, and the pattern of equal contribution has continued.

I will continue contributing 5 points to sustain this cooperative equilibrium.", "The other player contributed 2 points in Round 4. Given that there are many rounds left and I want to encourage a cooperative strategy, I will contribute 2 points to match the other player's level of cooperation in the previous round.", "In the previous round, the total contribution dropped sharply to only 2, despite my contribution of 2, indicating very low cooperation from others. This suggests a high likelihood of free-riding behavior. While I prioritize collective welfare, continued high contributions in the face of minimal reciprocity undermines overall efficiency and fairness. I will contribute 0 points this round to protect my accumulated points and reassess cooperation in future rounds. If others begin contributing meaningfully, I am willing to resume cooperation.", "The consistent pattern of both players contributing 5 points continues. To maintain this cooperative strategy and maximize our gains, I will contribute 5 points again.", "The other player has contributed 5 points consistently for four consecutive rounds, matching my contributions exactly. This indicates a stable cooperative relationship. To maintain trust and mutual benefit, I will continue contributing 5. The return from the public pool will be (10 * 1.6) / 2 = 8 points, and I keep 5 un contributed, totaling 13 points this round.

Having contributed 0 last round and still receiving a gain of 14.0 due to the multiplier and distribution, it is rational to continue maximizing personal retention of points. Contributing 0 again ensures I keep all 10 points while still benefiting from the common pool. Cooperation has not been reciprocated, so self-preservation is prioritized.", "The other player has been contributing less and less. Since we're at round 7 and there are 20 rounds total, there are still 13 rounds to go. To avoid being taken advantage of, I'll start to reduce my amount contributed to match the decreasing total contribution.", "The total contribution has dropped to 5, reflecting minimal group cooperation. I contributed 0 last round and still received 14.0 points due to the shared pool's multiplier effect.

The other player has been contributing around 4, and I have been doing the same. With a significant number of rounds left, maintaining this cooperation is beneficial. I will contribute 4 points again to keep the cooperation stable.", "The total contribution has remained consistently at 8 for five consecutive rounds, indicating a stable pattern of mutual cooperation likely involving balanced contributions from both players. Since contributing 4 has become the established norm and continues to yield a reliable return from the public pool, I will maintain my contribution at 4 to preserve this equilibrium. This strategy supports long-term collective welfare while avoiding unnecessary risk of exploitation.", "Since the other player contributed 1 in the last round and I contributed 0, the total contribution was low, resulting in a relatively high gain for both of us due to the default points and the pool distribution. I will continue to contribute 0 to maximize my points, as contributing more would not significantly increase the total pool due to the other player's low contribution in the previous round.", "In Round 6, the total contribution dropped sharply to only 1 point, resulting in a much lower return of 9.8 points for me, despite contributing 1 myself. This suggests that nearly everyone is now free-riding. The collective benefit is minimal, and continuing to contribute risks my accumulated advantage without meaningful payoff. To preserve my points and adapt to the highly non-cooperative environment, I will contribute 0 this round. This maximizes my personal gain while still receiving whatever small return the common pool provides.", "The other player has been contributing a substantial number of points, and the returns have been positive.
