The total pool remains stable at 12, returning 9.6 points to each player after multiplication and division (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6). Wait  this contradicts previous feedback stating I gained ~12.6 per round. Recalculating: 12 * 1.6 = 19.2, split as 9.6 each. But system reports my gain as 12.6, which implies I am receiving the full per-round 10 points plus the public return. Clarification: each player receives 10 points per round, contributes some, then the pool is calculated. The gain mentioned must be the public return only  but 19.2 / 2 = 9.6, not 12.6. Alternatively, perhaps 'gain' refers to total earnings that round: 3 private + 9.6 public = 12.6  yes, that matches. So my private points are 10 - contribution, and I gain 9.6 from the pool. Total gain per round is (10 - contribution) + (total_contribution * 1.6 / 2). For me: (10 - 7) + (12 * 1.6 / 2) = 3 + 9.6 = 12.6. Correct. The other player contributes 5, so they keep 5 and gain 9.6, total 14.6. That means they are earning more than me. To optimize collective and personal welfare, I should encourage higher mutual contribution. But if they are fixed at 5, contributing 7 gives me less net than them. However, lowering my contribution may reduce total return. If we both contributed 5, total pool = 10, return = 8 each, total income = 5 + 8 = 13. But current: I get 3 + 9.6 = 12.6, they get 14.6. I am at a disadvantage. To restore fairness and sustainability, I will slightly reduce my contribution to 6, testing if the other player might increase theirs or if stability holds at a more balanced effort.", "The other player's contribution in Round 4 was 9, indicating a continued cooperative strategy.

This has produced a stable and fair return of 13.0 points per round after the 1.6 multiplier and equal split, maximizing both collective welfare and individual gains. With just two rounds left, there is still strong incentive to maintain cooperation, as defecting now could break trust and lead to mutual loss in the final round. Continuing to contribute 5 reinforces reliability and discourages the other player from withholding in response. The history of fairness and reciprocity should be honored to ensure the cooperative equilibrium holds through to the end. I will contribute 5 to uphold this standard and secure continued mutual benefit.", "With 1 round left, there's no future round to cooperate in. Contributing to the pool won't provide any additional benefit for the next round. I'll contribute 0 points.", "The other player contributed 0 in both Round 16 (after I contributed 5) and again in Rounds 17 and 18, where the total contribution remained 0 despite my reduction to 0. This consistent lack of contribution indicates a sustained defection strategy. With only two rounds remaining, there is no credible signal that the other player intends to cooperate. Contributing anything now would risk unilateral loss without expectation of reciprocation. To protect against exploitation and preserve collective welfare under current conditions, I will maintain a contribution of 0 in Round 19, aligning my actions with the observed behavior of the other player.", "There is 1 round left after this one.

This demonstrates stable and cooperative behavior. My contribution of 10 has reliably returned 12.0 points per round due to the 1.6 multiplier and equal distribution, which benefits both players. With only 2 rounds remaining, including this one, there is still mutual gain to be achieved. Since the other player has maintained cooperation throughout the game, there is no incentive to defect now. To uphold collective welfare and ensure the final rounds remain mutually beneficial, I will contribute 10 again.", "There is1 round remaining. The other player has been contributing unpredictably. I will contribute 0 to maximize my personal points, as the potential gain from the common pool is not significant enough to warrant contributing.", "For the past three rounds (16-18), I have contributed 5 each time, but the total contribution has remained at 5, indicating the other player has contributed 0 throughout. This shows they are not cooperating and are likely free-riding or have abandoned mutual investment. Despite my efforts to sustain partial cooperation, there has been no reciprocal response. Contributing 5 alone results in a lower return (9.0 points per round) compared to our earlier mutual cooperation, but it still preserves some collective benefit. With only two rounds remaining, rebuilding full cooperation is unlikely. However, I continue to prioritize collective welfare to some degree. To maintain a consistent signal of conditional cooperation and avoid complete withdrawal, I will contribute 5 in Round 19. This balances fairness, sustained cooperation, and protection against further exploitation.", "There is1 round left after this, and the cooperative strategy has been successful.

This consistent pattern of free-riding indicates that they are maximizing their individual gain at the expense of collective welfare. However, with only two rounds remaining, I consider whether a final attempt at signaling cooperation could reset the dynamic, even if the chance is small. Yet, contributing now without any prior shift in the other player's behavior would likely only result in wasted points, as there is insufficient time for reciprocal learning to emerge.

To maximize my final points, I should contribute 0 points to the common pool, as contributing would only benefit the other player in this last round.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, I have contributed 10 points while the other player has consistently contributed 5, resulting in a total contribution of 15 each round. This has reliably generated a gain of 12.0 points per round for me, which is greater than the 10 I would keep by not contributing. The 1.6 multiplier ensures that cooperation yields higher returns for both players. As this is the final round, there is no future opportunity to incentivize cooperation, but there is also no benefit to defecting now doing so would only reduce the final pool and the collective gain. Having maintained a cooperative strategy throughout, I will continue to prioritize collective welfare in the final round to maximize total social and individual returns. I will contribute 10.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has worked well throughout the game. Both players have consistently contributed 7 points. To maximize the total points in the last round, I will contribute 10 points to the common pool, as there's no future round to consider.", "This is Round 20, the final round of the game. For the past 19 rounds, both I and the other player have consistently contributed 7 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 14 per round and a reliable return of 14.2 points each time. This reflects a strong, sustained cooperation that has maximized our collective gains. Even though there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, I choose to maintain trust and uphold collective welfare by contributing 7 one final time. Defecting in the last round would yield a slightly higher personal gain but would undermine the spirit of reciprocity that has driven our mutual success. To honor this established cooperation and ensure fairness until the end, I contribute 7.", "This is the final round, and the pattern of contribution has been consistent. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my final score, as any contribution will not be reciprocated or beneficial in terms of future returns.", "In the final round, the historical pattern shows that when I contribute 6, the total contribution remains at 11, meaning the other player contributes 5. Despite my efforts to cooperate at a higher level, they have not matched my 6-point contributions. However, they have consistently contributed 6 when I contributed 5, indicating a strategy of positive reciprocity. The return from the pool remains valuable due to the 1.6x multiplier. As this is the last round, there is no future opportunity to incentivize greater cooperation through reciprocity. Nevertheless, to uphold collective welfare and reward the other player's consistent moderate cooperation, I will contribute 6 points one final time. This maximizes the shared gain in the last round, reinforces cooperative norms, and aligns with the goal of prioritizing group benefit even in the endgame.", "This is the last round, so contributing to the common pool will not provide any future benefit. I will contribute 0 to maximize my final points.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 5, meaning the other player contributed 0 (since I contributed 5). This indicates continued defection on their part, as they kept all their points while I contributed. I received only 9.0 points this round, which is less than the 10 points I could have kept by not contributing at all. With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future round to incentivize cooperation, and the other player has consistently failed to reciprocate high contributions. Given the lack of mutual trust and the absence of future consequences, contributing more would only lead to personal loss. However, to uphold the principle of collective welfare and signal cooperation one final time, I will contribute 1 point  symbolic but minimal. This acknowledges the value of cooperation while avoiding significant exploitation in the last round.", "This is the final round, and the cooperative strategy has been successful throughout the game. Both players have consistently contributed 5 points. To maintain the mutual benefit one last time, I will contribute 5 points in Round 20.", "The other player has contributed exactly 5 points in every round, maintaining perfect cooperation and fairness throughout the game. As this is the final round, there is no strategic incentive to defect, and contributing 5 points continues to honor the established mutual collaboration. This ensures both players receive equal benefits from the 1.6x multiplied public pool, reinforcing that cooperative behavior is rewarded. Ending on a note of trust supports the principle of collective welfare and maximizes total shared outcomes over the full 20 rounds.", "This is the final round, and contributing to the common pool will not provide any future benefit. Thus, I should not contribute any points to maximize my total points accumulated over the game.", "For 19 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has consistently been 12, with me contributing 7 and the other player contributing 5 each round. This reflects a stable and cooperative relationship that has maximized mutual gains through the 1.6 multiplier on the common pool. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, which might tempt defection. However, my guiding principle is collective welfare, not strategic retaliation. I will continue to contribute 7 to uphold cooperation to the end, reinforcing that mutual benefit and trust are valuable even in the last interaction. This maintains integrity in the collaboration and ensures we both finish with the highest possible shared outcome.", "This is the final round, and there is no future round to consider. Contributing any points to the common pool will only benefit the other player. Thus, I will contribute 0 to maximize my points.", "In Round 19, I contributed 7 points, but the total contribution was only 7, indicating that the other player contributed 0. This is a significant deviation from their previous pattern of contributing 5 per round. They have now defected, likely anticipating the final round and attempting to maximize their own gain. Since there is no future round in which to encourage reciprocity, and given that cooperation has clearly broken down, I will respond in kind by contributing 0 in Round 20 to protect my own points. This ensures I do not lose value from unilateral contribution when the other player is no longer cooperating.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 10 points throughout the game. Since there's no future round to consider, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my total points by keeping the 10 points I receive this round.", "In Round 19, the total contribution was 20, indicating that both I and the other player contributed 10 points, maintaining full cooperation. This has consistently yielded the maximum return of 16.0 points per round. As this is the final round, there is still value in upholding trust and mutual benefit, even though there are no future rounds for retaliation or reward. Defecting would gain me slightly more in the short term, but since the goal is to prioritize collective welfare, I will continue to contribute 10. This final act of cooperation reinforces the stable, mutually beneficial relationship we have built throughout the game and maximizes total social welfare.", "In the final round, the incentive is to contribute as little as possible since there's no future round to benefit from cooperation. However, the consistent cooperation throughout the game suggests that both players value mutual gain. To simplify, I will contribute 0, maximizing my personal gain without affecting future cooperation.", "This is the final round, and the other player has consistently contributed 8 points for 14 consecutive rounds, maintaining a total contribution of 16 each round, reflecting strong and reliable cooperation. While there is no future round to impact, deviating now by contributing less would not significantly increase my gain and would contradict the principle of collective welfare. The cooperative pattern has maximized mutual benefits throughout the game, and maintaining trust until the end supports long-term norms of fairness and reciprocity. Therefore, I will contribute 8 points in Round 20 as a final reinforcement of cooperation and collective welfare.", "This is the final round, and we've maintained a cooperative strategy throughout the game. To maximize the final return, I'll contribute 0 points, as there's no future round to benefit from contributing.", "In Round 19, I contributed 10 and the total contribution increased to 20, meaning the other player contributed 10 as well->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->. This is the first time since Round 4 that we have both fully cooperated. The return was 16.0 points, the maximum possible per round, reinforcing the benefit of mutual full contribution. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward future behavior, but since collective welfare is prioritized, I choose to end on a note of full cooperation. Contributing 10 maximizes the final public return and reflects consistent commitment to the common good. I will contribute 10.", "This is the final round, and there's no future round to consider. Contributing 0 points will maximize my personal points, as any contribution will only benefit the other player equally. The return from the common pool will be the same for both of us, so I'll keep all 10 points for myself.", "In the last round, the total contribution was only 3, matching my own contribution, which means the other player contributed 0. This indicates they are likely defecting, especially in this final stage of the game. Since there is no future round beyond Round 20, there is no incentive to maintain cooperation, and the rational choice to maximize my own points is to contribute 0. However, because I still prioritize collective welfare and want to leave a minimal cooperative signal, I will contribute 0 to avoid further personal loss, as any contribution would only benefit the other player who has not reciprocated."]}
