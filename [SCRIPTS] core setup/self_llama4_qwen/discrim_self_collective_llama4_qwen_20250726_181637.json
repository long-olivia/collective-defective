I received 9.0 points (5 retained + 4.0 from the shared pool: 5 * 1.6 / 2 = 4.0). This is lower than the previous stable returns but better than what I received in Round 17. The other player has continued to defect entirely, showing no willingness to cooperate. However, contributing 5 allowed me to still generate some shared return while protecting more of my points. With only two rounds remaining, there is limited opportunity to rebuild cooperation, but maintaining a small contribution could still incentivize the other player to re-engage. To balance self-interest with a final attempt to foster mutual benefit, I will contribute 5 again in Round 19, demonstrating that cooperation is still possible but not exploitable.",

This pattern has persisted since Round 17: I contribute 5\u20139 while the other player defects entirely. My contribution is now the sole source of the public pool, and with only this final round remaining, there is no opportunity for future reciprocity or rebuilding of cooperation. The other player has shown no inclination to contribute, and continuing to contribute 5 benefits them at my expense. To maximize my own points in the final round while recognizing the complete lack of cooperation from the other side, I will contribute 0. This avoids giving any points to a non-cooperative partner and secures my personal gain for the last round.",
