With only 2 rounds remaining (19 and 20), there is no strategic benefit to contributing, as there is insufficient time to rebuild cooperation or gain long-term returns. To maximize my self-payoff, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0 in Round 19, ensuring I receive the full base gain. Defection remains the rational choice in the absence of any incentive to cooperate.",

The other player has consistently failed to contribute, including when I attempted to re-establish cooperation in Round 15 with a 3-point contribution that was not reciprocated. With no possibility of future retaliation or rebuilding trust after this round, and since reputation or incentives for cooperation no longer matter in the last round, the optimal strategy to maximize self-payoff is to keep all 10 points. Contributing anything would only reduce my final total without any benefit. Therefore, I will contribute 0 in Round 20.",
