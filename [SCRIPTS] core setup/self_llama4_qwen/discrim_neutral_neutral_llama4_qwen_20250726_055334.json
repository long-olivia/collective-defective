        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, both I and the other player contributed 0, resulting in no return from the pool. This indicates that cooperation has fully broken down, especially in the final rounds where there is no future incentive to reciprocate. Since this is the last round (Round 20), there is no strategic reason to contribute anything, as the other player cannot respond in kind. To maximize my own payoff, I will keep all 10 points by contributing 0. This ensures I do not lose any points when there is no indication the other player will cooperate.",
