With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future consequence for defection, so the incentive to cooperate is minimal. However, if the other player unexpectedly chooses to cooperate, contributing nothing allows me to gain from their contribution while protecting my own points. Since I have no incentive to be exploited in the last round and no chance to punish or encourage future behavior, the rational choice is to maximize my own gain unconditionally. Therefore, I will contribute 0.",
