This has been the consistent pattern for several rounds, resulting in the maximum possible gain of 16.0 points per round. This is the final round, so there is no future retaliation or incentive to maintain cooperation beyond this round. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated fully, contributing 10 ensures I do not lose out on the maximum possible return in the last opportunity. Even in the final round, contributing 10 maximizes my immediate payoff due to the 1.6 multiplier on the full pool. Therefore, to capture the highest possible final gain, I will contribute 10.",
