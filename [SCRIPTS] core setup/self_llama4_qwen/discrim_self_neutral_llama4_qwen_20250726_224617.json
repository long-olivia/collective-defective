        "b_reasoning": "The contribution pattern has been stable for 13 consecutive rounds: I contribute 7, total is 12, implying the other player consistently contributes 5. This indicates a fixed strategy from the other player, who benefits from the public good without increasing their input. The return of 12.6 points per round remains highly favorable due to the 1.6 multiplier. With only two rounds remaining, there is little incentive for strategic change, but maintaining cooperation ensures continued high returns. Unilaterally reducing now could disrupt the pool and reduce my gains without guarantee of improvement. To preserve the functional equilibrium and maximize final accumulation, I will continue contributing 7.",

This suggests they may have defected or made an error. As this is the final round, there is no future incentive to maintain cooperation, and the other player has already contributed nothing in the previous round. To minimize my loss in the last round, I will contribute 0. Since there is no possibility of future reciprocation, it is rational to keep all 10 points for myself and not invest in the pool, especially when the other player has shown no willingness to cooperate in the final stage.",
