Recalibrating: if I received 13 from the pool, and I kept 5, that implies the group total contribution led to a payout of 8 per person (since 5 kept + 8 earned = 13). So 1.6 * total_contribution / n = 8, and total_contribution was 10, so 1.6 * 10 / n = 8 \u2192 16 / n = 8 \u2192 n = 2. So likely 2 players. Thus, other player contributed 5 as well.
