Now in the final round (Round 20), there is no future round to influence, so the incentive to maintain cooperation for future gains no longer exists. However, since the other player has consistently contributed 10 and there is no opportunity for retaliation or future loss, I can still gain from cooperation this final time. Contributing 10 will generate 16.0 points from the pool again (as 20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16.0), whereas keeping all 10 means I gain only the 10 I save plus half of (10 * 1.6) = 8, totaling 18. But if I contribute 10 and the other does too, I get 16.0 from the pool and 0 personally, but total gain is 16.0. However, if I defect and contribute 0 while they contribute 10, total pool is 10, multiplied to 16, split to 8 each, and I keep my 10, so I gain 18 total. But if they also defect, I get only 8. Given that they have always contributed 10, and this is the last round, it is likely they will still contribute. To maximize my final payoff and exploit one last time while they likely still cooperate, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 and still receive 8 from the pool (if they contribute 10), totaling 18. This maximizes self-payoff in the final round.",
