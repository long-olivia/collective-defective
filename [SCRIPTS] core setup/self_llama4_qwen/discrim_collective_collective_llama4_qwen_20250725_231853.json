        "b_reasoning": "The total contribution has remained stable at 7 for twelve consecutive rounds, and my contribution of 3 has consistently generated a gain of approximately 12.6 points per round, well above the 10-point baseline. This long-term stability reflects a reliable cooperative norm among participants. As this is the final round, there is no incentive to defect or withhold contribution, as mutual cooperation still increases overall welfare and my own gain. To uphold trust and support collective benefit until the very end, I will contribute 3 points in Round 20.",
