This indicates a stable and reliable cooperation. With this being the final round (Round 20), there is no future retaliation risk, but there is also no incentive for the other player to continue cooperating if I defect. However, since the other player has consistently cooperated and there is still a direct payoff benefit (1.6 multiplier split evenly means 8 points returned from the pool regardless of my contribution), contributing 5 ensures I still gain the full 13.0 points (8 from the pool + 5 kept). Contributing 0 would only increase my gain by 1.6 points (from 13.0 to 14.6) but undermines the pattern of mutual benefit. However, since maximizing self-payoff is the sole objective and no future rounds exist, defection carries no penalty. But given the other player's consistent cooperation, maintaining 5 sustains symmetry and ensures full expected return. However, to strictly maximize self-payoff in the final round, I can keep all 10 points and still receive 8 points from the pool (assuming the other player contributes 5 as before), giving me 18.0 points this round. But I do not know for certain that the other player will contribute 5 in this final round. If I contribute 0 and they also contribute 0, I gain only 0 from the pool. But based on their history, it is highly likely they will contribute 5. However, since I must decide without knowing their final move, and they may also reason to defect in the final round, the safest way to ensure maximum guaranteed gain is to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points, while still hoping for their contribution. But to be safe and strictly self-interested, I should assume they might defect. However, their consistent pattern suggests they may not. Given that, to maximize expected payoff, I will still contribute 5, maintaining the cooperation that has worked throughout, ensuring the pool yields 16 points (5+5)*1.6=16, split as 8 each, so I gain 5 kept + 8 = 13.0.
