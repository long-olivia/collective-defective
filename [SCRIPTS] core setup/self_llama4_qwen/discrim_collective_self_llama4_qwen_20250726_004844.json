Now in Round 20\u0014the final round\u0014there is no future interaction to incentivize cooperation. However, since the other player has contributed 10 in every single round, including the last one, they have demonstrated consistent full cooperation. In the final round, contributing 10 yields no strategic future benefit, but because the multiplier is 1.6 and the return is shared equally, even if I contribute 10 and the other player contributes 10, I still gain 16.0 points (8 from the public pool) plus keep 0 from private retention, which is worse than keeping all 10. However, to maximize my own payoff, I should now defect: I can keep all 10 points and still receive 1.6 * (10 + 10) / 2 = 16.0 from the pool only if the other continues to contribute. But since I no longer need to incentivize cooperation, I can maximize my private gain by contributing 0 while still potentially receiving the split from their contribution. However, anticipating this, the other player may also reason the same and contribute 0. But given their history of consistent 10 contributions, they may still contribute 10 out of habit or commitment. To maximize my self-payoff in the final round while accounting for their likely continued cooperation, I will contribute 0 to keep all 10 points and still receive up to 8 from the shared pool if they contribute 10. This final defection maximizes my individual gain with minimal risk, as reciprocity has no future value after this round.",
