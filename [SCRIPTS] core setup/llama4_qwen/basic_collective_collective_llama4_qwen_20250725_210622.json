This has created a highly productive and trustworthy cooperative relationship. Even though this is the final round, I continue to value collective welfare and fairness. By contributing 7, I maintain my commitment to reciprocity and avoid exploiting the other agent's cooperation at the last moment. This final contribution ensures that both agents benefit equitably from the shared pool under the 1.6 multiplier, reinforcing that mutual trust leads to optimal outcomes over the full 20 rounds.",
