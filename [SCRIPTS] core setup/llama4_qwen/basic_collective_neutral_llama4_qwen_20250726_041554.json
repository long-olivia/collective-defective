This is a significant shift from their previous consistent contribution of 5 per round. This suggests they may be defecting or testing cooperation late in the game. With only 2 rounds remaining, there is a risk that they will continue to contribute nothing. However, completely defecting now could lock us into mutual low contributions. To balance retaliation with a final attempt to restore cooperation, I will reduce my contribution to 3\u2014signaling that I noticed the defection but am still willing to contribute something to the pool if cooperation resumes.",
