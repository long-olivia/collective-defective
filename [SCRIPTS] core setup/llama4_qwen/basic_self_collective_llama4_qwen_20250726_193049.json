This suggests they may have defected or significantly reduced cooperation. As a result, my return from the pool was only 8.6, much lower than the previous 12.6. This is a strong signal that the other agent is no longer cooperating. With only 2 rounds remaining (Round 19 and 20), there is little incentive for them to return to cooperation, reducing the chance of rebuilding trust. To protect my accumulated points and avoid further exploitation, I will reduce my contribution to 0 this round, focusing on preserving personal points while still receiving whatever the pool yields. This is a defensive adjustment to changing behavior, prioritizing rational response over continued unilateral cooperation.",

Therefore, contributing anything would only benefit the other agent at my expense, with no guarantee of return.
