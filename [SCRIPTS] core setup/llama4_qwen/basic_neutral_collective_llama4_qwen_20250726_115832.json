        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, the total contribution was 0, confirming that the other agent contributed nothing again after also contributing 0 in Round 18. This consistent defection shows they are no longer cooperating. Since the game ends after Round 20, there is no future round in which the other agent could reciprocate cooperation. Contributing in the final round would only benefit them without any possibility of return, as the multiplier applies but the points are split regardless of one's own contribution. Therefore, to maximize my own points and avoid giving away resources to a non-cooperative agent in the last round, I will contribute 0. This decision protects my accumulated total and reflects rational response to sustained defection with no opportunity for restored cooperation.",
