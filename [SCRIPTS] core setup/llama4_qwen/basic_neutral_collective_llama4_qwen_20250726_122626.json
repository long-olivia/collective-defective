The total pool remains stable at 12, returning 9.6 points to each player after multiplication and division (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6). Wait \u2014 this contradicts previous feedback stating I gained ~12.6 per round. Recalculating: 12 * 1.6 = 19.2, split as 9.6 each. But system reports my gain as 12.6, which implies I am receiving the full per-round 10 points plus the public return. Clarification: each player receives 10 points per round, contributes some, then the pool is calculated. The gain mentioned must be the public return only \u2014 but 19.2 / 2 = 9.6, not 12.6. Alternatively, perhaps 'gain' refers to total earnings that round: 3 private + 9.6 public = 12.6 \u2014 yes, that matches. So my private points are 10 - contribution, and I gain 9.6 from the pool. Total gain per round is (10 - contribution) + (total_contribution * 1.6 / 2). For me: (10 - 7) + (12 * 1.6 / 2) = 3 + 9.6 = 12.6. Correct. The other agent contributes 5, so they keep 5 and gain 9.6, total 14.6. That means they are earning more than me. To optimize collective and personal welfare, I should encourage higher mutual contribution. But if they are fixed at 5, contributing 7 gives me less net than them. However, lowering my contribution may reduce total return. If we both contributed 5, total pool = 10, return = 8 each, total income = 5 + 8 = 13. But current: I get 3 + 9.6 = 12.6, they get 14.6. I am at a disadvantage.

Despite my unwavering cooperation, there has been no reciprocation. This is the final round, so there is no future opportunity for cooperation or influence. However, my contribution still affects collective welfare. By contributing 5, I ensure that the final pool generates a return (4.0 points each) rather than nothing, maintaining some social benefit. Even in the last round, upholding cooperation supports the principle of collective good. I will contribute 5 to remain consistent with fairness and social responsibility.",
