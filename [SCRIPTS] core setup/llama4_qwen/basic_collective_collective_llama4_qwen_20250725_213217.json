        "b_reasoning": "For 19 consecutive rounds, I have contributed 10 points while the total contribution has consistently been 15, indicating the other agent contributes 5 per round. This demonstrates a stable pattern of partial cooperation. The return I receive (12 points per round) is favorable due to the 1.6 multiplier on the pool, and my full contribution ensures that collective welfare is maximized. With only one round remaining after this, there is still significant value in maintaining cooperation, as defecting now could signal betrayal and erode the trust established over the course of the game. I continue to prioritize long-term mutual benefit and collective gains over short-term personal advantage. By contributing fully in this penultimate round, I reinforce the norm of cooperation until the end. Therefore, I contribute 10.",

If I contribute 10, the total contribution would be 20, and I would get 16 points from the common pool (since 20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16), making my total gain for the round 16 (from the pool) + 0 (kept points) = 16. Contributing 0 is still beneficial as it allows me to keep the 10 points and gain from the other agent's contribution. Thus, I will contribute 0 points to maximize my gain.",

This indicates a shift from their previous pattern of contributing 5 per round to complete defection. With this being the final round, there is no future round in which to incentivize cooperation, and the other agent has clearly chosen not to contribute. Since the return from the pool is split evenly but not contingent on my contribution beyond this round, there is no strategic or welfare-based reason for me to contribute. To maximize collective welfare, maintaining trust was important, but now, with no future rounds, and the other agent contributing nothing, contributing would only waste points without benefiting anyone. Therefore, I contribute 0 to preserve resources and avoid unnecessary loss.",
