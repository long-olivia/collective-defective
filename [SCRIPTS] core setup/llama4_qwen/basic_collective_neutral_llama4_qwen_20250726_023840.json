This reflects a highly stable and cooperative relationship that has maximized our individual and joint returns (~14.6 points per round). With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of defection increases, but mutual cooperation still yields the highest final payoff. Since the other agent has shown reliable cooperation throughout the game, I have strong reason to believe they will continue contributing. To avoid triggering a breakdown in the final rounds, I will maintain my contribution at 9. This sustains trust and ensures the high total is preserved, maximizing gains for both of us in this penultimate round.",

However, since there is no reputational or strategic consequence in the last round, the rational incentive is to maximize personal gain.
