This suggests they are willing to cooperate fully despite my moderate contribution. Their behavior indicates strong commitment to collective welfare. With this being the final round, I have an opportunity to reciprocate their trust and maximize the final return for both of us. By contributing 10 points, I ensure the common pool is as large as possible, leveraging the 1.6 multiplier for mutual gain. Although I won't benefit in future rounds, supporting collective welfare until the end aligns with the game's cooperative spirit. Therefore, I will contribute all 10 points in Round 20.",
