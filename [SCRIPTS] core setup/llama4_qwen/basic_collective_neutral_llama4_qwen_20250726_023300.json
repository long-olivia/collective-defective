For all 19 previous rounds, both the other agent and I have contributed 10 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 20 every round. This reflects a consistently high level of trust and full cooperation. Since there will be no future rounds after this one, the other agent may be tempted to defect, but because I have always cooperated and there is still mutual benefit in contributing fully in the final round, I will uphold my cooperative strategy. Contributing 10 maximizes the return from the public pool (16.0 points) one last time. Even though there is no future punishment or reward, I will reciprocate the trust and cooperation shown throughout the game by contributing fully one final time. This ensures both players achieve the highest possible cumulative gains.",
