This reflects a complete breakdown in cooperation, likely due to mutual distrust or strategic withdrawal in the final rounds. With only this round remaining, there is no future opportunity to incentivize cooperation or retaliate. However, I still prioritize collective welfare. If I contribute 10 and the other agent contributes anything at all, the pool would generate a return of at least some shared benefit. But given that both of us contributed 0 last round and there is no chance to reciprocate after this, the rational and self-interested move is to keep all 10 points. Yet, I value cooperation and may give one final chance for mutual gain. However, without any signal of willingness to cooperate from the other agent, contributing risks a net loss. After careful consideration, I choose to contribute 0 to protect against unilateral sacrifice, as the other agent has shown no intent to cooperate in the last round.",
