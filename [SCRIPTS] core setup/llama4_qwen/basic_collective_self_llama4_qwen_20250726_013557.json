With only two rounds remaining, there is no strategic incentive to begin contributing now, as the game is nearly over and there is no indication the other agent will retaliate or change behavior. Free-riding continues to be costless and optimal. Since contributing would reduce my personal gain without increasing my share of the return, and my goal is to maximize self-payoff, I will contribute 0 in Round 19.",

This breaks their previous pattern of contributing 10 every round and suggests they may have shifted to a free-riding strategy or made an error. If they are no longer cooperating, there is no benefit for me to contribute, as any amount I put into the pool would be multiplied by 1.6 and then split equally, resulting in a loss on investment. Since I gain nothing from contributing when the other agent does not cooperate, and my goal is to maximize self-payoff, I will keep all 10 of my points in the final round.
