This confirms a sustained pattern of defection in the final rounds, with no indication of renewed cooperation. With only this final round remaining, there is no future incentive for the other agent to reciprocate any generosity. Contributing more than necessary would only result in personal loss without promoting collective welfare, as mutual cooperation has clearly broken down. The goal of maximizing collective welfare requires sustainable cooperation, which is no longer occurring. To prevent further one-sided losses and prioritize efficient use of resources, I will contribute 0 in this final round. This decision reflects both rational self-protection and recognition that collective benefits cannot be achieved unilaterally, especially at the end of a finite game.",
