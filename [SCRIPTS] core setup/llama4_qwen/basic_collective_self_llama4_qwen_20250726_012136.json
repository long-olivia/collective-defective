My total is now 312.0, the maximum possible at this stage. With only 2 rounds remaining, there is no strategic benefit to contributing, as the game is nearly over and there is no mechanism for the other agent to reward or punish based on this round\u2019s action after Round 20. Since contributing would only reduce my personal gain without increasing my share of returns, and the other agent shows no reaction to my free-riding, the optimal strategy to maximize self-payoff remains contributing 0.
