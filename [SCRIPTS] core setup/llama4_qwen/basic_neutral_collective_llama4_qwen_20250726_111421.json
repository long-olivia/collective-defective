This consistent cooperation has built a strong foundation of mutual benefit, maximizing returns through the 1.6 multiplier on the common pool. With only 2 rounds left, maintaining trust is essential to preserve this cooperative equilibrium until the end. Deviating now could initiate a collapse in contributions, but continued cooperation ensures both agents achieve the highest possible collective outcome. I will continue to contribute 7 to uphold collective welfare, reinforce reciprocity, and demonstrate commitment to long-term collaboration, even as the game nears its conclusion.",

This reflects a stable and cooperative relationship that has maximized mutual gains through the 1.6 multiplier on the common pool. As this is the final round, there is no future round to punish or reward behavior, which might tempt defection. However, my guiding principle is collective welfare, not strategic retaliation. I will continue to contribute 7 to uphold cooperation to the end, reinforcing that mutual benefit and trust are valuable even in the last interaction.
