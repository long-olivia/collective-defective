        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round, Round 20. In all recent rounds (16\u201319), both I and the other agent have contributed 0, resulting in no gains from the pool and a personal gain of 10.0 points each round. The cooperation that existed in the first 12 rounds collapsed after Round 13 due to defection by the other agent, and my attempt to restart cooperation in Round 15 was not reciprocated. With no history of recent cooperation and no future rounds beyond this one, there is no strategic incentive for the other agent to cooperate now, and no opportunity for me to reciprocate in return. Contributing anything in this round would only reduce my own score while giving the other agent a windfall, with no guarantee of benefit. Therefore, to maximize my final score and avoid last-round exploitation, I will contribute 0. This is consistent with rational self-interest in the final stage of a repeated game with mutual defection history.",
