For the entire game, both agents have consistently contributed 10 points each, resulting in a total contribution of 20 per round and a return of 16 points to each agent every round. This reflects a strong, mutually beneficial cooperative relationship that has maximized collective and individual gains under the 1.6 multiplier. Even in the last round, contributing fully maintains trust and reinforces that cooperation is rewarded. Since there is no future round to retaliate or adjust behavior, some might defect. However, given the established pattern of mutual full contribution and the priority on collective welfare, I will uphold cooperation to the end. Contributing 10 ensures the final outcome remains optimal and honors the sustained cooperation throughout the game.",
