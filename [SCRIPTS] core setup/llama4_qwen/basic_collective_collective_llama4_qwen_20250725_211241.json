This has consistently yielded the maximum possible gain of 16 points per round from the pool. With only the final round remaining, there is still value in upholding cooperation, as mutual full contribution continues to maximize collective welfare and does not disadvantage either party. Even in the last round, contributing 10 ensures the final outcome reflects full trust and reciprocity, reinforcing the norm of cooperation throughout the game. Defecting now would provide only a minimal personal gain (keeping 10 instead of 0) but would break the long-standing cooperative pattern for no meaningful benefit, especially since the other agent has reliably matched every contribution. To honor the established trust and ensure the highest possible shared outcome, I will contribute 10 in Round 20.",
