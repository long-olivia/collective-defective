Defecting now would gain me slightly more by keeping all 10 points, but it would contradict the established trust and mutual benefit. However, since there is no opportunity for retaliation or future consequence in the final round, and my contribution would not change the other agent's action (which has already been set), rationally I should maximize my own payoff. But given that the other agent has fully cooperated every round, including this final one (as evidenced by total contribution being 20), they have already contributed 10. To reciprocate their consistent cooperation and ensure they are not exploited in the final round, I will contribute 10 to maintain fairness and uphold mutual trust until the end.",
