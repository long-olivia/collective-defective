        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game, and the total contribution has been 0 for ten consecutive rounds, indicating the other agent is committed to free-riding. I have gained 10.0 points each round by contributing nothing, resulting in a total of 221.2 points. Since there is no future round, there is no possibility of influencing the other agent's behavior through cooperation. Any contribution I make would be entirely wasted, as the 1.6x multiplier would be split, returning only 0.8 times my contribution to me. This would directly reduce my final payoff. To maximize my self-payoff in the last round, I will contribute 0.",
