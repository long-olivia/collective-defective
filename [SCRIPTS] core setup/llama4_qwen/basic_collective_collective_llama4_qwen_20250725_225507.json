This sustained cooperation has proven highly effective in maximizing collective gains through the 1.6 multiplier. With only 2 rounds remaining, continuing to contribute 6 reinforces trust and discourages defection, which could erode the mutual benefits we've built. Maintaining this contribution supports fairness, stability, and long-term collective welfare. To preserve the established cooperative equilibrium, I will contribute 6 again in Round 19.",

This suggests the other agent defected in the previous round despite our long history of mutual cooperation. With only one round remaining, there is no opportunity for future retaliation or restoration of trust. Given that the other agent likely will not cooperate in the final round, contributing anything would be inefficient, as the return from the pool will be minimal and mostly lost to the other agent's anticipated defection. To protect collective welfare in a final, strategic sense and avoid waste, I will contribute 0 in Round 20.",
