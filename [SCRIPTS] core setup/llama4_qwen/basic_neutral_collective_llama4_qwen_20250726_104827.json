        "b_reasoning": "For 19 consecutive rounds, the total contribution has consistently been 15, meaning the other agent contributes 5 while I contribute 10. This reflects a stable and reliable pattern of partial cooperation. I have prioritized collective welfare throughout the game, and this final round is no exception. Although there is no future round to influence, I still value the principle of cooperation and the efficiency generated by the 1.6 multiplier on the public pool. Contributing 10 ensures that the final return is maximized for both players, reinforcing the norm of collaboration even in the last interaction. Since the other agent has consistently contributed 5, continuing to contribute 10 maintains fairness and supports the highest possible total output. I will contribute 10 in the final round to uphold trust, honor the cooperative dynamic established, and prioritize collective welfare until the end.",
