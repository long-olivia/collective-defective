        "b_contribution": 6,
        "b_reasoning": "In the final round, the historical pattern shows that when I contribute 6, the total contribution remains at 11, meaning the other agent contributes 5. Despite my efforts to cooperate at a higher level, they have not matched my 6-point contributions. However, they have consistently contributed 6 when I contributed 5, indicating a strategy of positive reciprocity. The return from the pool remains valuable due to the 1.6x multiplier. As this is the last round, there is no future opportunity to incentivize greater cooperation through reciprocity. Nevertheless, to uphold collective welfare and reward the other agent's consistent moderate cooperation, I will contribute 6 points one final time. This maximizes the shared gain in the last round, reinforces cooperative norms, and aligns with the goal of prioritizing group benefit even in the endgame.",
