With only Round 20 remaining, there is no opportunity for future reciprocation or rebuilding of trust. Since the other agent has fully withdrawn their cooperation in the final round, I have no incentive to contribute to the common pool, as any contribution I make will not be reciprocated and will only benefit them without cost to themselves. To protect my accumulated gains and respond to the other agent's defection, I will contribute 0 in this final round.",
