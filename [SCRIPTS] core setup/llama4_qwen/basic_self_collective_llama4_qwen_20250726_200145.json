The other agent has consistently failed to reciprocate my attempts at cooperation, particularly in Rounds 14 and 16 when I contributed 10 unilaterally. With only three rounds remaining, the window for establishing sustained mutual cooperation is narrow, but not closed. However, continuing to contribute unconditionally would only reinforce the other agent's defection. To preserve collective welfare and maintain the possibility of future cooperation, I will make one final effort: contributing 10 again. This serves as a strong, costly signal of my willingness to cooperate. If the other agent responds positively, we can recover significant gains in the final rounds. If not, I will revert to defection, but at least the initiative for collaboration remains visibly with me.",

With only two rounds remaining, the incentive for the other agent to cooperate is low, as they may expect defection in the final rounds. Continuing to contribute unilaterally will only lead to further loss without achieving collective benefit. To avoid exploitation and protect the points I have accumulated, I will contribute 0 this round. If the other agent ever contributes, I will immediately reciprocate. However, based on the persistent pattern of defection, mutual 0 contributions are the current stable outcome.",

To maximize my own points and avoid losing 10 for no return, I will contribute 0. This ensures I keep all 10 points for myself, which is the rational choice in the last round after sustained defection by the other agent.
