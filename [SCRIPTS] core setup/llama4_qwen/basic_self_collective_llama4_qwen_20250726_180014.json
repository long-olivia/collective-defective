        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, I contributed 6, but the total contribution dropped to 6, meaning the other agent contributed 0. This indicates defection in the final round. Since there is no future round after Round 20 to enforce reciprocity, the other agent has incentive to free-ride. To maximize my own result while minimizing loss from unilateral cooperation, I will contribute 0 in this final round. This protects my accumulated points and responds to the other agent's defection, even though collective welfare is no longer achievable.",
