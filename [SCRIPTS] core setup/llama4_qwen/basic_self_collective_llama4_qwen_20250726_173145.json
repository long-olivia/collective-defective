        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, I contributed 9, but the total contribution was only 9, meaning the other agent contributed 0. This indicates a complete withdrawal from cooperation, likely anticipating the final round. As a result, my return dropped sharply to 8.2 points. With only Round 20 remaining and no future rounds to incentivize reciprocity, contributing anything would benefit the other agent at my expense, especially since they contributed nothing last round. To maximize my own points and respond to the lack of cooperation, I will contribute 0 in this final round.",
