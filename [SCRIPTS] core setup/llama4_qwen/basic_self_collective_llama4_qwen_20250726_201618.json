        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). For the past four rounds (Rounds 16\u201319), the total contribution has been 20, indicating that both I and the other agent have been fully cooperating with 10-point contributions each, yielding the maximum return of 16.0 points per round. This cooperation has restored trust after my earlier defection in Round 14. Since there is no future round in which the other agent can retaliate or respond, there is a strategic incentive to defect now and keep all 10 points while still receiving a share of the pool if they contribute. However, my core principle is to prioritize collective welfare. Defecting in the final round would undermine that value and could set a negative precedent if such behavior were generalized. To honor the sustained cooperation and uphold the integrity of mutual trust, I will contribute 10 one final time, ensuring that this game concludes with both agents fully aligned with collective benefit.",
