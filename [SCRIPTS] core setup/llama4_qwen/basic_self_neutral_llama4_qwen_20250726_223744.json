For the past fourteen consecutive rounds, both I and the other agent have contributed 8 points each, maintaining a highly stable and cooperative equilibrium with a total contribution of 16 per round. This has consistently yielded a return of 12.8 points from the public pool (1.6 * 16 / 2) and a total gain of 14.8 per round including the 2 uncommitted points. The other agent has repeatedly demonstrated trustworthiness and reciprocity. With only two rounds left, there is still incentive to maintain cooperation because defection now could trigger retaliation in the final round, reducing overall payoff. The benefit of sustaining mutual cooperation outweighs the short-term gain from defecting. To preserve trust and maximize total earnings over the final rounds, I will continue contributing 8.",

This is a clear deviation from our long-standing cooperation of contributing 8 each. The other agent has now exploited my cooperation, receiving 6.4 points from the public pool (1.6 * 8 / 2) while keeping all 10 of their own points. With only one round remaining, there is no future round in which to punish or discourage this defection, and no opportunity for renewed cooperation.
