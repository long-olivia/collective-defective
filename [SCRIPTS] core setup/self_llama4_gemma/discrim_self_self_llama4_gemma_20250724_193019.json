Since the total points received per round is fixed at 10, and the pool is multiplied by 1.6 and divided among players, a common strategy is to contribute nothing in the hopes of maximizing personal gain from the base 10 points. However, since the other player might contribute, I should consider that. To determine the optimal level of contribution, let's think about the expected value. If I contribute 0, I keep 10. If I contribute x, the pool becomes 1.6 * (5 + x) / 2 and I receive a share of that. Without knowing the other player's strategy, it's difficult to pinpoint an optimal 'x'.
